# Token Efficiency Restoration - Implementation Summary

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE AND READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Intelligent Vault Section Selection
**Method:** `#selectRelevantVaultSections(vaultContent, query)` in orchestrator.js

**What It Does:**
- Takes the full vault content (~34K tokens)
- Extracts keywords from the user's query
- Splits vault into logical sections (by document boundaries)
- Scores each section by relevance to the query
- Selects top-scored sections up to 9,000 token limit
- Returns only the relevant sections

**Result:** Vault queries now send â‰¤9K tokens instead of 34K+ (73% reduction)

### 2. Token Budget Enforcement
**Method:** `#assembleContext(memory, documents, vault)` in orchestrator.js

**What It Does:**
- Enforces Memory budget: â‰¤2,500 tokens (truncates if exceeded)
- Enforces Document budget: â‰¤3,000 tokens (truncates if exceeded)
- Validates Vault budget: â‰¤9,000 tokens (pre-selected)
- Validates Total budget: â‰¤15,000 tokens (logs warning if exceeded)
- Tracks compliance in metadata

**Result:** All context types respect strict token limits

## What Can Be Verified Right Now

### âœ… Unit Tests (No API Keys Required)
```bash
npm run test-token-budgets-unit
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Tests passed: 5/5
Tests failed: 0/5
âœ… ALL TESTS PASSED
```

**What These Tests Prove:**
1. Mock vault (23,900 tokens) exceeds 9K limit â†’ requires selection
2. Token estimation math is accurate
3. Budget limits are consistent (14,500 â‰¤ 15,000)
4. Truncation produces exact target token counts
5. Context assembly enforces all budgets correctly

### âœ… Code Quality
```bash
node --check api/core/orchestrator.js
# No errors

npx eslint api/core/orchestrator.js
# Only minor warnings about unused imports (acceptable)
```

### âœ… File Changes
```bash
git diff main --stat
```

**Modified:**
- api/core/orchestrator.js: +824 lines, -19 lines
- package.json: +2 lines

**Added:**
- test-token-budgets-unit.js (unit tests)
- test-token-budgets.js (integration tests)
- TOKEN_EFFICIENCY_REPORT.md (technical docs)
- BEFORE_AFTER_ANALYSIS.md (cost analysis)
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (this file)

## What Needs API Keys to Verify

### ðŸ”‘ Integration Tests
```bash
npm run test-token-budgets
```

**Requires:**
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

**What These Tests Will Prove:**
1. Test 1: Simple query stays under 3K tokens
2. Test 2: Vault query stays under 12K tokens (with 9K vault limit)
3. Test 3: Document query stays under 6K tokens

**When to Run:** After deployment to staging/production with API keys

## Expected Cost Savings

### Conservative Estimate (100 vault queries/day):
- **Before:** 34,000 tokens Ã— 100 = 3.4M tokens/day
- **After:** 9,000 tokens Ã— 100 = 900K tokens/day
- **Savings:** 2.5M tokens/day = 75M tokens/month

**At Claude pricing ($3/MTok):**
- **Before:** $306/month
- **After:** $81/month
- **Savings:** $225/month = $2,700/year

### Realistic Estimate (with all query types):
- **Monthly savings:** $238.95 (70% reduction)
- **Annual savings:** $2,867.40

## How to Validate After Deployment

### Step 1: Check Logs for Budget Compliance
```bash
# Look for these log messages:
[BUDGET] âœ… Context within budget: 11500/15000 tokens
[VAULT SELECTION] Selected 3/18 sections: 8750 tokens
```

### Step 2: Check Response Metadata
```javascript
// In API response:
{
  "metadata": {
    "vaultTokens": 8750,  // Should be â‰¤9000
    "memoryTokens": 2500, // Should be â‰¤2500
    "documentTokens": 3000, // Should be â‰¤3000
    "totalContextTokens": 14250, // Should be â‰¤15000
    "budgetCompliance": {
      "memory": true,
      "documents": true,
      "vault": true,
      "total": true
    },
    "vaultSectionsSelected": 3,
    "vaultSelectionReason": "Keyword-matched 3 relevant sections"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Compare API Costs
```bash
# Check actual token usage in production
# Compare to baseline costs before implementation
# Expected: 70% reduction in context token usage
```

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Keyword Extraction
```javascript
// Removes stop words, extracts meaningful terms
Query: "What are the pricing policies?"
Keywords: ["pricing", "policies"]
```

### Section Scoring
```javascript
// Scores by relevance to keywords
- Keyword match: +10 points per occurrence
- Exact phrase match: +100 points
- Founder/directive content: +30 points
- Pricing/business content: +25 points
- Document headers: +20 points
```

### Section Selection
```javascript
// Greedy algorithm - highest scored sections first
1. Score all sections
2. Sort by score (descending)
3. Select sections until 9K token budget reached
4. Return selected content
```

### Budget Enforcement
```javascript
// Truncation for memory and documents
if (tokens > BUDGET) {
  const targetChars = BUDGET * 4;
  content = content.substring(0, targetChars);
  tokens = BUDGET;
}
```

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
1. Uses keyword matching (not semantic embeddings)
2. Greedy section selection (not optimal packing)
3. Truncation may cut mid-sentence

### Planned Enhancements:
1. Add embeddings-based semantic similarity for better section matching
2. Implement smarter truncation at sentence/paragraph boundaries
3. Cache frequently accessed vault sections for performance
4. Add A/B testing to compare keyword vs. semantic selection
