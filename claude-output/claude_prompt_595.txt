<h2>Rules</h2>
<h3>DO:</h3>
<ul>
<li>✅ Search the entire codebase to understand the system</li>
<li>✅ Trace the flow for each failing test</li>
<li>✅ Identify whether each failure is retrieval or prompt</li>
<li>✅ Fix the actual root cause</li>
<li>✅ Keep prompt additions minimal (under 10 lines)</li>
<li>✅ Test after each change</li>
</ul>
<h3>DO NOT:</h3>
<ul>
<li>❌ Add hundreds of lines of "emphatic" instructions</li>
<li>❌ Use 🚫 FORBIDDEN and ✅ REQUIRED markers</li>
<li>❌ Add checklists or repetitive emphasis</li>
<li>❌ Assume all failures are prompt issues</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Bible Standard</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"A caring family member remembers what you tell them, does simple math, recognizes ambiguity, and maintains their principles under pressure."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system must do this naturally — not because of 200 lines of SHOUTING IN THE PROMPT.</p>
<p><strong>Fix the bugs. Keep it simple. 39/39.</strong></p></body></html><!--EndFragment-->
