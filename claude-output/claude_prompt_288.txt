Issue #288: [claude-fix] Populate doctrine gates placeholder files with full implementation

Issue Description:
## Context

Placeholder files have been created. The bot can now use the Edit tool to populate them.

## Files to Populate

### 1. `/api/services/doctrine-gates.js`

Implement the 5 doctrine gates from issue #286:
- `evaluateUncertaintyStructure(response, context)`
- `evaluateBlindSpotVolunteering(response, context)`
- `evaluateAntiEngagementClosure(response)`
- `evaluateExampleQuality(response)`
- `calculateTruthFirstScore(gateResults)`
- `enforceDoctrineGates(response, context)` - Main function

Include all detection patterns (UNCERTAINTY_TRIGGERS, EXPLANATION_MARKERS, FRAMEWORK_MARKERS, ADVICE_TRIGGERS, BLIND_SPOT_MARKERS, ENGAGEMENT_BAIT, GENERIC_MARKERS, SPECIFIC_MARKERS).

### 2. `/api/services/response-enhancer.js`

Implement auto-fix functions:
- `addUncertaintyStructure(response, missingParts)`
- `addBlindSpots(response, context)`
- `removeEngagementBait(response)`
- `improveExamples(response)`
- `enhanceToPassGates(response, gateResults, context)` - Main function

### 3. `/api/config/doctrine-config.js`
```javascript
export const DOCTRINE_CONFIG = {
  enabled: true,
  enforcement: {
    standard: 'warn',
    strict: 'enhance',
    maximum: 'block'
  },
  currentLevel: 'enhance',
  minimumScores: {
    casual: 0.5,
    standard: 0.6,
    professional: 0.7,
    highStakes: 0.8
  },
  highStakesPatterns: [
    /invest|stock|crypto|financial/i,
    /medical|diagnosis|symptom|treatment/i,
    /legal|lawsuit|contract|liability/i,
    /suicide|self-harm|emergency/i
  ]
};
```

### 4. Modify `/api/routes/test-semantic.js`

Add `case 'test-doctrine-gates':` action with 5 test cases from issue #286.

### 5. Modify `/api/core/orchestrator.js`

Integrate doctrine gates into response pipeline (after AI response, before personality application).

## Acceptance Test
```javascript
fetch("https://sitemonkeys-ai-system-production.up.railway.app/api/test-semantic?action=test-doctrine-gates", {
  headers: { "X-Internal-Test-Token": "sitemonkeys-fullcheck-abc123" }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log(JSON.stringify(d, null, 2)));
```

Should return results showing all 5 test cases evaluated correctly.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
