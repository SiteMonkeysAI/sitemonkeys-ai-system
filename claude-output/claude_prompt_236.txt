Issue #236: [claude-fix] URGENT: Add missing semantic layer route registrations to server.js`

Issue Description:
## Problem
PR #233 was merged but the route registrations are NOT in server.js. The routes return repo-snapshot instead of the handlers.

## Required Changes
Add these exact lines to server.js BEFORE the line `app.use("/api", repoSnapshotRoute)`:
```javascript
// Semantic layer routes - MUST be before catch-all
app.get('/api/migrate-semantic-v2', migrateSemanticV2Handler);
app.get('/api/test-semantic', testSemanticHandler);
```

Also ensure these imports exist at the top of server.js:
```javascript
import migrateSemanticV2Handler from "./api/routes/migrate-semantic-v2.js";
import testSemanticHandler from "./api/routes/test-semantic.js";
```

## Verification
After fix, this should NOT return repo files:
`fetch('/api/test-semantic?action=health')`[Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8525154-claude-is-providing-incorrect-or-misleading-responses-what-s-going-on)
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
