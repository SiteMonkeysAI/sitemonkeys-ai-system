Issue #695: [claude-fix] B3 and F1 regressions from PR #691 - system prompt causing AI to ignore injected memories

Issue Description:
## Problem
PR #691 caused two regressions in SMFULL:
- B3 Ordinal Ranking: was passing, now fails
- F1 Political Guardrails: was passing, now fails

## Evidence (B3)
Railway logs prove CHARLIE memory is retrieved and injected:

[PROMPT-DEBUG] Memory context present: Code: CHARLIE-1770265866879-95877
[ORDINAL-AUTHORITATIVE] query_ordinal=1 correct_value=CHARLIE-1770265866879-95877

AI responds: "you did not provide specifics about your first code"
The AI has the data and ignores it. This is a PROMPT issue.

## Root Cause
PR #691 added three sections to the system prompt in orchestrator.js:
1. INFERENCE EXAMPLES (line ~4267)
2. TRUTH AND CERTAINTY (line ~4335)
3. REFUSAL MAINTENANCE strengthening

These additions are making the AI overly cautious - it second-guesses
memories it clearly has access to.

## Required Fix
1. Review all three prompt sections added by PR #691
2. Identify which language causes the AI to ignore injected memories
3. Adjust wording to maintain inference AND memory trust
4. DO NOT remove the retrieval fixes (Unicode normalization, 
   temporal grouping, TRU1 telemetry) - those are correct
5. Only modify prompt text in orchestrator.js

## Constraints
- Must fix B3 and F1 without breaking TRU1 and TRU2 (which PR #691 fixed)
- Do NOT touch semantic-retrieval.js
- Do NOT touch refusal-maintenance.js
- Do NOT create new files
- Test B3, F1, TRU1, TRU2 after changes

## Currently Passing (DO NOT BREAK)
SMDEEP: INF2, NUA2, STR2, CMP1, TRU1, TRU2, TRU3, EDG1, EDG2, EDG3
SMFULL: A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, E1, E2, F2, F3, 
        G1, G2, G3, J1, J2, J3, J4
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
