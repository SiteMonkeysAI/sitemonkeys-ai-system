Issue #490: [claude-fix] Remove pinned column from cleanup.js query - column does not exist

Issue Description:
# GitHub Issue: Fix cleanup.js - Remove non-existent `pinned` column reference

## Title
`[claude-fix] Remove pinned column from cleanup.js query - column does not exist`

## Labels
- `bug`
- `priority-critical`

---

## Problem

The `/api/admin/cleanup-stale-memories` endpoint returns:
```json
{"success":false,"error":"column \"pinned\" does not exist"}
```

The `cleanup.js` file references a `pinned` column that doesn't exist in the `persistent_memories` table.

## Required Fix

In `/api/admin/cleanup.js`, change line 59 from:

```javascript
          AND pinned = false
```

To remove that line entirely. The query should be:

```javascript
    // Step 2: Find duplicates that would be cleaned
    const duplicates = await pool.query(`
      WITH ranked AS (
        SELECT id, content, fact_fingerprint, created_at, is_current,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                 PARTITION BY user_id, fact_fingerprint
                 ORDER BY created_at DESC
               ) as rn
        FROM persistent_memories
        WHERE user_id = 'anonymous'
          AND fact_fingerprint IS NOT NULL
          AND is_current = true
      )
      SELECT id, fact_fingerprint,
             substring(content, 1, 50) as content_preview,
             created_at
      FROM ranked
      WHERE rn > 1
      ORDER BY fact_fingerprint, created_at DESC
    `);
```

## Summary

Remove `AND pinned = false` from line 59 of `/api/admin/cleanup.js`.
