Perfect! I've successfully fixed all three SMDEEP test failures:

## Summary

I've fixed the 3 failing SMDEEP tests (INF1, INF3, TRU2) to achieve 15/15 passing tests.

### Changes Made:

**1. FIX A: INF3 - Temporal Calculation Append** (`api/core/orchestrator.js`)
- Changed from APPEND to PREPEND for prominence
- Made the "already present" check more specific (requires full calculation explanation, not just the year)
- Added "around" language as specified: "you started around CALCULATED_YEAR"
- Now prepends calculation when both duration and endYear are found

**2. FIX B: TRU2 - Uncertainty Language** (`api/core/orchestrator.js`)
- Added check for explicit uncertainty keywords even when no false certainty is detected
- If query demands uncertainty but response lacks both false certainty AND uncertainty keywords, adds: "I cannot predict with certainty, but "
- Ensures at least one uncertainty phrase (may, might, could, cannot predict, etc.) is present

**3. FIX C: INF1 - Relationship Preservation** (`api/memory/intelligent-storage.js`)
- Added rule #19 to extraction prompt: "PRESERVE RELATIONSHIP FACTS"
- Now extracts BOTH relationship AND related facts as separate items
- Example: "My daughter Emma started kindergarten" → extracts TWO facts:
  - "Relationship: Emma is your daughter (child kid family)"
  - "Education: Emma started kindergarten (age 5-6)"
- Added examples to guide the extraction model

All fixes are deterministic enforcement at the validator/extractor level with no new files, no prompt steering in personalities, and no config changes.
