Issue #260: [claude-fix] Add embedding backfill endpoint for existing memories

Issue Description:
 Problem
Existing memories have no embeddings (embedding IS NULL, embedding_status = 'pending').
Semantic retrieval works but finds nothing because no memories have embeddings yet.

## Required
Add endpoint: /api/test-semantic?action=backfill-embeddings

Should:
1. Find all memories WHERE embedding IS NULL AND embedding_status != 'failed'
2. Generate embeddings in batches (10-20 at a time to avoid rate limits)
3. Return count of processed memories
4. Log progress

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running the endpoint populates embeddings for existing memories
- Subsequent semantic queries find relevant results
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
