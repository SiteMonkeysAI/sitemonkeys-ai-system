Perfect! Let me create a summary of the changes:

---SUMMARY---

I successfully implemented the browser-based memory test endpoint `/api/test/memory-check` as requested in issue #180. Here's what was done:

## Files Modified:

### server.js

**Changes made:**

1. **Added the memory test endpoint (lines 410-515):**
   - Created `GET /api/test/memory-check` route around line 410 (after the main chat endpoint)
   - Implements security check: only accessible when `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=private` or `DEBUG_MODE=true`
   - Tests three key memory operations:
     - **Test 1:** Store a unique tripwire phrase (ZEBRA-TEST-{timestamp})
     - **Test 2:** Recall the tripwire phrase from memory
     - **Test 3:** Check for false ignorance claims (phrases like "don't have", "no memory", etc.)
   - Returns styled HTML results page with:
     - Test run ID and user ID
     - Pass/fail status for each test
     - Detailed test results in JSON format
     - Visual styling with color-coded pass (green) / fail (red) indicators

2. **Exposed orchestrator globally (line 651):**
   - Added `global.orchestrator = orchestrator;` after orchestrator initialization
   - Required for the test endpoint to access the orchestrator's `processRequest` method
   - Includes logging confirmation: "[SERVER] ✅ Orchestrator exposed as global.orchestrator"

3. **Removed unused import (line 67):**
   - Removed `import testRoutes from "./api/routes/test.js";` which referenced a non-existent file
   - This was causing import errors on server startup

4. **Removed unused route registration (line 628):**
   - Removed `app.use("/api/test", testRoutes);` since we're implementing the endpoint inline
   - Prevents conflicts and removes dependency on non-existent routes file

## How the endpoint works:

1. User visits `/api/test/memory-check` in their browser (only in debug/private mode)
2. Endpoint generates a unique tripwire phrase with timestamp
3. Simulates a chat conversation to store the tripwire in memory
4. Waits 2 seconds for storage to complete
5. Simulates another chat asking for the test phrase
6. Validates that:
   - The tripwire was successfully stored
   - The tripwire was successfully recalled
   - No false ignorance claims were made
7. Returns a styled HTML page with detailed test results

## Security:

- Endpoint is protected and only runs when `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=private` or `DEBUG_MODE=true`
- Returns 403 Forbidden in production mode
- Uses isolated test user IDs that won't interfere with real user data

The implementation matches the exact specification provided in the issue, including the security check, test structure, HTML styling, and result formatting.
