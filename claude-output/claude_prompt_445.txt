Issue #445: [claude-fix] Issue #444: CRITICAL HOTFIX - earlyClassification is not defined

Issue Description:
# Issue #444: CRITICAL HOTFIX - earlyClassification is not defined

## Priority: EMERGENCY

**The system is completely broken. 21.9% pass rate. Every request fails.**

## The Error

```
[ORCHESTRATOR ERROR] [AI] Routing failed ReferenceError: earlyClassification is not defined
    at #routeToAI (file:///app/api/core/orchestrator.js:2917:95)
```

## Root Cause

PR #443 introduced `earlyClassification` variable in `processRequest()` but references it in `#routeToAI()` where it's **not in scope**.

The variable is defined around line 467-480 in `processRequest()`:
```javascript
let earlyClassification = null;
try {
  earlyClassification = await classifyQueryComplexity(message, { truth_type: 'UNKNOWN' });
  // ...
}
```

But then referenced at line 2917 in `#routeToAI()`:
```javascript
const systemPrompt = this.#buildSystemPrompt(mode, analysis, context.reasoningGuidance, earlyClassification);
```

`earlyClassification` doesn't exist in `#routeToAI` scope.

## The Fix

**Option A: Pass through context object**

In `processRequest()`, add to the context object before calling `#routeToAI`:
```javascript
context.earlyClassification = earlyClassification;
```

Then in `#routeToAI()`, change line 2917 from:
```javascript
const systemPrompt = this.#buildSystemPrompt(mode, analysis, context.reasoningGuidance, earlyClassification);
```
to:
```javascript
const systemPrompt = this.#buildSystemPrompt(mode, analysis, context.reasoningGuidance, context.earlyClassification);
```

**Option B: Pass as parameter**

Add `earlyClassification` as a parameter to `#routeToAI()` and pass it when calling.

## Files to Modify

- `/api/core/orchestrator.js`
  - Line ~870: Add `earlyClassification` to context before `#routeToAI` call
  - Line ~2917: Change `earlyClassification` to `context.earlyClassification`

## Verification

After fix:
1. System should not throw "earlyClassification is not defined"
2. Requests should complete without emergency fallback
3. Test pass rate should return to 81%+ baseline

## DO NOT

- Do not add any new features
- Do not refactor anything else
- Do not change any logic
- ONLY fix the variable scope issue

This is a 2-line fix. Nothing more.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
