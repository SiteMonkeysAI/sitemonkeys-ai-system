Issue #270: [claude-fix] Live-proof polling not detecting embedding completion

Issue Description:
CRITICAL: live-proof must pass. All other tests now pass.

## Symptom
Logs show embedding generated successfully:
[EMBEDDING] ✅ Generated for memory 881 (148ms)
[EMBEDDING] ✅ Embedding generated for memory 881 (ready)

But 40 seconds later, live-proof reports:
"Embedding not ready after 30 seconds. Status polling timed out."

## Root Cause
The polling query in live-proof is not finding the updated embedding_status='ready'.

## Investigation Required
In test-semantic.js live-proof action:
1. What query is used to poll for embedding status?
2. Is it using the correct memory ID (881)?
3. Is there a WHERE clause mismatch?

## Required Fix
The polling should query:
SELECT embedding_status FROM persistent_memories WHERE id = $1

And detect when embedding_status = 'ready'

Add debug logging:
[LIVE-PROOF] Polling memory {id}, status: {status}

## Acceptance Criteria
live-proof returns passed: true

## Current Status
- test-paraphrase: ✅ PASSED
- test-supersession: ✅ PASSED  
- test-mode-isolation: ✅ PASSED
- live-proof: ❌ FAILED (this issue)
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
