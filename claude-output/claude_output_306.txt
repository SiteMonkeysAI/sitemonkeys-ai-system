Good! The file doesn't import `fs`, which confirms it should not be using file system operations. The Buffer.from() is a built-in Node.js function that doesn't require an import. Now let me create a summary of the changes:

## Fixed Issue #306: Document Ingestion Test - Removed File Dependency

### Problem
The `test-document-ingestion` endpoint was attempting to load a test PDF file that doesn't exist (`./test/data/05-versions-space.pdf`), causing an ENOENT error.

### Solution
Updated the test in `/api/routes/test-semantic.js` (lines 1445-1484) to use inline test data instead of relying on external files:

#### Changes Made:

1. **Replaced file-based test data with inline Buffer creation**:
   - Changed from: `fs.readFileSync('./test/data/05-versions-space.pdf')`
   - Changed to: `Buffer.from(...)` with comprehensive AI/ML test content

2. **Updated test content** to match issue requirements:
   - Used the AI and machine learning content exactly as specified in the issue
   - Content covers: artificial intelligence, machine learning, data learning, pattern identification, deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing

3. **Updated all references**:
   - Changed `testBuffer` to `testContent` for clarity
   - Updated filename from `'test-document.txt'` to `'test-ai.txt'` throughout
   - Maintained `'text/plain'` mimetype as required
   - Created `testText` string variable for validation purposes

4. **No external dependencies**:
   - Test now runs completely self-contained
   - No file system operations required
   - All test data is created inline within the test function

### Files Modified:
- `/api/routes/test-semantic.js` - Lines 1445-1484 (test-document-ingestion case)

### Verification:
The test should now pass all 6 sub-tests:
1. Text Extraction
2. Text Chunking  
3. Document Storage
4. Embedding Generation
5. Semantic Search
6. Mode Isolation

The changes ensure the test will work reliably without any external file dependencies, using inline Buffer data as specified in the acceptance criteria.
