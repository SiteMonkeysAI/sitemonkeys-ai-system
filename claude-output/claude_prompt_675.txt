Issue #675: [claude-fix] Anchors stored but not boosting retrieval - A5 still fails

Issue Description:
## Evidence
FIX-673 logs show anchors ARE being stored:
- `anchor_keys=[ordinal,explicit_token] explicit_token=1`
- `anchor_keys=[unicode] unicode=7`

But A5 (ZEBRA token recall) still fails.

## Root Cause
`semantic-retrieval.js` now SELECTs metadata (PR #673), but likely:
1. Not parsing `metadata.anchors` after retrieval
2. Not applying anchor boost to relevance scoring
3. Or anchor matching logic not triggered

## Required Fix
In `semantic-retrieval.js`, after fetching memories with metadata:
1. Parse `JSON.parse(row.metadata)` if string
2. Check `metadata.anchors.explicit_token` for matches
3. Apply boost to memories with matching anchors

## Test
A5 should pass - ZEBRA token should be recalled via explicit_token anchor match.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
