Issue #679: [claude-fix] DIAGNOSTIC: Full system audit - test scores regressing despite targeted fixes

Issue Description:
## Situation
Multiple targeted fixes (PRs #673, #675, #677) have NOT improved test scores.
SMDEEP went from 10/15 → 8/15 (regression).

## Known Symptoms
- A5: ZEBRA token not recalled (explicit memory)
- CMP2: International names lost (was passing, now failing)  
- STR1: Volume stress fails (car fact not recalled)
- INF1/INF3: Inference tests failing
- NUA1: Ambiguity not recognized

## Request
Do NOT make targeted fixes. Instead:

1. TRACE a single memory from storage → retrieval end-to-end
2. IDENTIFY where data is being lost or corrupted
3. CHECK if recent PRs introduced regressions
4. LOOK for architectural issues (race conditions, async timing, object mutations)

Output a diagnostic report BEFORE proposing any code changes.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
