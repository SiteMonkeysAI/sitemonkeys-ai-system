Issue #310: [claude-fix] Issue: Add test endpoint for truthTypeDetector.js

Issue Description:
Issue: Add test endpoint for truthTypeDetector.js
File to modify: /api/routes.js (or your main routes file - verify location with grep -r "app.get\|router.get" /api/)
Task: Add a test endpoint for Phase 4 truthTypeDetector
Add this import at the top of the routes file:
javascriptimport { testDetection } from './core/intelligence/truthTypeDetector.js';
Add this route:
javascript// Phase 4: Truth Type Detector test endpoint
app.get('/api/test-semantic/truth-type', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const query = req.query.q;
    
    if (!query) {
      return res.json({
        success: true,
        message: 'Truth Type Detector endpoint operational',
        usage: 'Add ?q=your+query to test classification',
        examples: [
          '/api/test-semantic/truth-type?q=What%20is%20the%20current%20price%20of%20Bitcoin',
          '/api/test-semantic/truth-type?q=Who%20is%20the%20CEO%20of%20Apple',
          '/api/test-semantic/truth-type?q=What%20is%20the%20Pythagorean%20theorem'
        ]
      });
    }
    
    const result = await testDetection(query);
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[truthTypeDetector] Test endpoint error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: error.message });
  }
});
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Endpoint responds at `/api/test-semantic/truth-type`
- [ ] Without query param: returns usage instructions
- [ ] With `?q=` param: returns truth type classification
- [ ] Response includes: `type`, `confidence`, `stage`, `high_stakes`, `ttl_ms`

**Test after deploy:**
```
/api/test-semantic/truth-type?q=What%20is%20the%20current%20price%20of%20Bitcoin
Expected: type: "VOLATILE"

/api/test-semantic/truth-type?q=Who%20is%20the%20CEO%20of%20Apple
Expected: type: "SEMI_STABLE"

/api/test-semantic/truth-type?q=What%20is%20the%20Pythagorean%20theorem
Expected: type: "PERMANENT"
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
