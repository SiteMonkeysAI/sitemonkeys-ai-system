Issue #356: [claude-fix] Issue: lookup_attempted fix applied to wrong file - needs to be in orchestrator.js

Issue Description:
Context: PR #354 correctly identified the bug (lookup_attempted not set on success), but fixed it in /api/lib/ai-processors.js. However, the actual chat flow uses /api/core/orchestrator.js, not ai-processors.js.
Evidence: After PR #354 merged, multi-word queries still return lookup_attempted: false:

"Venezuela" → true ✅
"attack Venezuela" → false ❌
"Did the US attack Venezuela this morning" → false ❌

Task: Apply the SAME fix to /api/core/orchestrator.js:
Find where lookupResult.success && lookupResult.data is handled and ensure BOTH branches set lookup_attempted: true:
javascriptif (lookupResult.success && lookupResult.data) {
  phase4Metadata.external_lookup = true;
  phase4Metadata.lookup_attempted = true;  // ← ADD THIS LINE
  phase4Metadata.source_class = "external";
  // ... rest of success handling
} else {
  phase4Metadata.external_lookup = false;
  phase4Metadata.lookup_attempted = true;  // Already exists
  // ...
}
Also verify: Is the lookup even being CALLED for multi-word queries? Add logging:
javascriptconsole.log('[ORCHESTRATOR] About to call lookup for:', message);
If the lookup isn't being called at all, the trigger condition is the problem, not the metadata reporting.
Acceptance:
javascriptconst queries = [
  "Venezuela",
  "attack Venezuela", 
  "Did the US attack Venezuela this morning",
  "What is happening in Ukraine",
  "Israel Gaza news"
];
// ALL must return lookup_attempted: true
Your task is to:

3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
