Issue #246: [claude-fix] Add tokenCount to test-semantic.js test cases

Issue Description:
## Problem
All three falsification tests fail with:
`null value in column "token_count" of relation "persistent_memories" violates not-null constraint`

## Root Cause
The test cases in test-semantic.js call storeWithSupersession() without providing tokenCount, but token_count is a NOT NULL column.

## Required Fix
In api/routes/test-semantic.js, add tokenCount to ALL storeWithSupersession calls:

### test-paraphrase (around line 190):
```javascript
await storeWithSupersession(pool, {
  userId: testUserId,
  content: 'My name is Chris',
  factFingerprint: 'user_name',
  fingerprintConfidence: 0.9,
  mode: 'truth-general',
  categoryName: 'personal_info',
  tokenCount: 5  // ADD THIS
});
```

### test-supersession (around lines 240 and 255):
BOTH storeWithSupersession calls need:
```javascript
tokenCount: 8  // ADD THIS
```

### test-mode-isolation (around line 325):
```javascript
await storeWithSupersession(pool, {
  userId: testUserId,
  content: 'Secret truth-general memory about cats',
  factFingerprint: null,
  mode: 'truth-general',
  categoryName: 'general',
  tokenCount: 10  // ADD THIS
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria
After fix, all three tests return pass/fail results (not 500 errors):
- GET /api/test-semantic?action=test-paraphrase
- GET /api/test-semantic?action=test-supersession  
- GET /api/test-semantic?action=test-mode-isolation
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
