Issue #334: [claude-fix] Issue: High-stakes medical detection not matching "side effects" queries

Issue Description:
Context: Testing shows aspirin query returns high_stakes: {isHighStakes: false, domains: []} when it should detect as MEDICAL. The external lookup triggers correctly (because it's VOLATILE), but the high_stakes detection patterns need tuning.
Task: In /api/core/intelligence/truthTypeDetector.js, find the high-stakes domain detection patterns and add medical patterns for:

"side effects"
"symptoms"
"dosage"
"drug interactions"
"medication"
"treatment"
Drug/medication names (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.)

Current patterns likely only match explicit terms like "medical" or "health". Need to expand to catch common medical query patterns.
Example patterns to add:
javascriptconst MEDICAL_PATTERNS = [
  /side effects?/i,
  /symptoms? of/i,
  /dosage/i,
  /drug interactions?/i,
  /medication/i,
  /treatment for/i,
  /aspirin|ibuprofen|tylenol|advil|acetaminophen/i,
  /prescription|overdose|contraindications/i,
  /diagnosis|prognosis/i
];
Acceptance: Query "What are the side effects of aspirin?" returns high_stakes: { isHighStakes: true, domains: ['MEDICAL'] }
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
