Issue #188: [claude-fix] Fix cleanup endpoint routing - currently hitting wrong handler

Issue Description:
Problem
The URLs /api/debug/cleanup-boilerplate-preview and /api/debug/cleanup-boilerplate are returning the file inventory response instead of the cleanup preview. The routes aren't being matched correctly.
Evidence
Visiting /api/debug/cleanup-boilerplate-preview returns:
json{"status":"success","fileCount":5417,"totalChars":11860979,"files":[...]}
This is the repo snapshot response, not the cleanup preview.
Likely Cause
Either:

The debug routes aren't registered before the catch-all route in server.js
The route paths don't match what was intended
The debug router isn't properly exported/imported

Task

Check /api/routes/debug.js - ensure the cleanup routes are defined correctly
Check server.js - ensure debug routes are registered BEFORE any catch-all routes
Verify the route paths match exactly: /api/debug/cleanup-boilerplate-preview and /api/debug/cleanup-boilerplate
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
