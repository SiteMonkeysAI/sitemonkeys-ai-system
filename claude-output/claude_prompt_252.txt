Issue #252: [claude-fix] Remove non-existent "importance" column from semantic-retrieval.js

Issue Description:
## Problem
Semantic retrieval fails with:
`ERROR: column "importance" does not exist`

The SELECT query in semantic-retrieval.js references an `importance` column that doesn't exist in the persistent_memories table.

## Root Cause
In api/services/semantic-retrieval.js, the SELECT query includes `importance` which is not a real column.

## Required Fix
In api/services/semantic-retrieval.js, find the SELECT query and REMOVE the `importance` column:

Change FROM:
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  content,
  category_name,
  mode,
  embedding,
  fact_fingerprint,
  fingerprint_confidence,
  importance,  -- REMOVE THIS LINE
  created_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at)) / 86400 as days_ago
FROM persistent_memories
```

Change TO:
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  content,
  category_name,
  mode,
  embedding,
  fact_fingerprint,
  fingerprint_confidence,
  created_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at)) / 86400 as days_ago
FROM persistent_memories
```

Also search for any JavaScript code that references `importance` and either remove it or set a default value.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No more "column importance does not exist" errors
- test-paraphrase shows `candidates_considered > 0`
- test-paraphrase returns `passed: true`
