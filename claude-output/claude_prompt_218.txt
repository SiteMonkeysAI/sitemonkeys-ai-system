Issue #218: [claude-fix] # Issue #217: CRITICAL - Dedup Token Comparison Still Broken

Issue Description:
## Evidence

Logs show:
```
[DEDUP] ✓ Token overlap found: ALPHA-1767217285502, BRAVO-1767217285502 exists in memory - merge allowed
[STORE-CONFIRM] ❌ Failed to confirm CHARLIE-1767217285502 after 5 attempts
```

The NEW content has CHARLIE. The EXISTING memory has ALPHA and BRAVO.
CHARLIE ≠ ALPHA and CHARLIE ≠ BRAVO.
**There is NO overlap, but the function says "overlap found".**

## Root Cause

The `shouldPreventMerge` function is checking the WRONG condition. It appears to be checking:
- "Does the existing memory have high-entropy tokens?" (YES - ALPHA, BRAVO)

Instead of:
- "Does CHARLIE appear in [ALPHA, BRAVO]?" (NO - should BLOCK merge)

## Required Fix

The overlap check must verify that at least one NEW token appears in the EXISTING tokens array:
```javascript
// newTokens = ['CHARLIE-xxx']
// existingTokens = ['ALPHA-xxx', 'BRAVO-xxx']

const hasOverlap = newTokens.some(newToken => 
  existingTokens.some(existingToken => 
    newToken.toUpperCase() === existingToken.toUpperCase()
  )
);

// hasOverlap should be FALSE because CHARLIE is not in [ALPHA, BRAVO]
// Therefore shouldPreventMerge should return TRUE (block the merge)
```

## Expected Log After Fix
```
[DEDUP] 🛡️ No overlap: new=[CHARLIE-1767217285502] vs existing=[ALPHA-1767217285502,BRAVO-1767217285502] - BLOCKING merge
[INTELLIGENT-STORAGE] ✨ Storing new compressed memory
[STORE-CONFIRM] ✅ Confirmed CHARLIE-1767217285502 stored as ID 805

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
