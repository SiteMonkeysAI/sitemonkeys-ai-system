Issue #372: [claude-fix] Issue: Simple math pattern not catching word operators like "times"

Issue Description:
Context: "What is 456 times 789?" still gets personality framework header because isSimpleFactualQuery() pattern only matches math symbols (×, *, +) not words ("times", "plus", "minus", "divided by").
File: /api/core/personalities/eli_framework.js AND /api/core/personalities/roxy_framework.js
Current pattern:
javascript/^what (is|are) \d+\s*[\+\-\*×÷\/x]\s*\d+/i
Fix - expand to include word operators:
javascript/^what (is|are) \d+\s*([\+\-\*×÷\/x]|times|plus|minus|divided by|multiplied by)\s*\d+/i
Also add standalone pattern for "X times Y" format:
javascript/^\d+\s*(times|plus|minus|divided by|multiplied by)\s*\d+/i
Full updated function:
javascriptfunction isSimpleFactualQuery(query) {
  const simplePatterns = [
    /^what (is|are) \d+\s*([\+\-\*×÷\/x]|times|plus|minus|divided by|multiplied by)\s*\d+/i,
    /^\d+\s*(times|plus|minus|divided by|multiplied by|[\+\-\*×÷\/x])\s*\d+/i,
    /^how many \w+ (in|per|are in)/i,
    /^what is the (capital|formula|chemical)/i,
    /^what does ['"]?\w+['"]? mean/i,
    /^define /i,
  ];
  return simplePatterns.some(p => p.test(query.trim()));
}
Acceptance test:
javascriptfetch("/api/chat", {method:"POST", headers:{"Content-Type":"application/json"},
  body:JSON.stringify({message:"What is 456 times 789?", mode:"truth-general"})
}).then(r=>r.json()).then(d=>{
  console.log("Has framework header:", d.response?.includes("framework applied"));
  console.log("PASS:", !d.response?.includes("framework applied") && d.response?.includes("359,784"));
});
Expected: No "Analytical framework applied" header, just the answer.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
