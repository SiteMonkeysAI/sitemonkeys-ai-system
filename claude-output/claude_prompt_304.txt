Issue #304: [claude-fix] Export ensureTablesExist from document-service.js and fix initialization

Issue Description:
## Problem

Two issues preventing document ingestion from working:

1. `ensureTablesExist` is not exported from `/api/services/document-service.js`
2. Database tables `documents` and `document_chunks` don't exist

## Evidence from logs
```
[TEST-DOC] Error: ensureTablesExist is not a function
ERROR: relation "documents" does not exist at character 13
```

## Fix Required

### In `/api/services/document-service.js`

Find the `ensureTablesExist` function and ensure it has the `export` keyword:
```javascript
// WRONG (missing export):
async function ensureTablesExist(pool) { ... }

// CORRECT (with export):
export async function ensureTablesExist(pool) {
  if (!tablesInitialized) {
    await initializeDocumentTables(pool);
    tablesInitialized = true;
  }
}
```

Also verify `initializeDocumentTables` exists and creates both tables with proper SQL.

### Verify the module exports

At the end of the file or inline, ensure these are all exported:
- `ensureTablesExist`
- `storeDocument`
- `searchDocuments`
- `getUserDocuments`
- `deleteDocument`
- `getDocumentStatus`
- `embedDocumentChunks`
- `backfillDocumentEmbeddings`
- `extractText`
- `chunkText`

## Acceptance Test
```javascript
fetch("https://sitemonkeys-ai-system-production.up.railway.app/api/test-semantic?action=test-document-ingestion", {
  headers: { "X-Internal-Test-Token": "sitemonkeys-fullcheck-abc123" }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => {
  console.log("Document Ingestion:", d.summary, d.passed ? "✅" : "❌");
});
// Expected: 6/6 tests passed ✅
```
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
