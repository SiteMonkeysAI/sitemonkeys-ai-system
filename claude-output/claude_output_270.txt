Excellent! The changes look good. Now let me create a summary of the fix:

---SUMMARY---

## Issue Analysis
The live-proof test was failing because the polling query used to detect embedding completion was using a `LIKE` pattern match on the content:

```sql
WHERE user_id = $1 AND content LIKE $2
```

This pattern match (`content LIKE '%testFact%'`) was unreliable because:
1. The content stored in the database might not exactly match `testFact`
2. The `/api/chat` endpoint might process or modify the content before storage
3. The pattern matching added unnecessary complexity

## Fix Applied
Modified the polling query in `/api/routes/test-semantic.js` (lines 745-780) to:

### Changes Made:
1. **Simplified the query** - Removed the `content LIKE` clause and now query only by `user_id`:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, embedding_status, embedding
   FROM persistent_memories
   WHERE user_id = $1
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1
   ```

2. **Enhanced debug logging** - Added the requested debug format:
   ```javascript
   console.log(`[LIVE-PROOF] Polling memory ${memoryId}, status: ${currentStatus}, has_embedding: ${hasEmbedding}`);
   ```

3. **Improved error handling** - Added explicit logging when no memory is found yet during polling

4. **Maintained correct logic** - Still checks that both `embedding_status = 'ready'` AND `embedding !== null` before considering it ready

## Why This Works
Since `testUserId` is unique to each test run (includes timestamp), we can safely query by user_id alone and get the most recently created memory. This is more reliable than trying to pattern-match the content, which was causing false negatives.

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ Polling now queries: `SELECT embedding_status FROM persistent_memories WHERE user_id = $1`
✅ Detects when `embedding_status = 'ready'` AND `embedding !== null`
✅ Added debug logging: `[LIVE-PROOF] Polling memory {id}, status: {status}, has_embedding: {bool}`
