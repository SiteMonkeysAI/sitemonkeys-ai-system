Perfect! I have successfully completed all fixes for Issue #406. The three interconnected problems have been addressed:

1. **Semantic Routing:** Enhanced domain phrases so queries about Bitcoin, weather, news, etc. correctly classify to their appropriate domains instead of defaulting to mental_emotional

2. **External Lookup Source Selection:** Expanded news structure patterns to catch "top news stories", "weather" queries, and "celebrity gossip" so they properly route to Google News RSS or trigger graceful degradation

3. **Reasoning Escalation Enforcement:** Implemented actual correction application by building reasoning scaffolds that prompt for missing reasoning steps, ensuring the system works harder when uncertain instead of stopping early

All changes follow the system's core principles and maintain the "CEO, not warehouse worker" behavioral contract where uncertainty triggers more effort, not less.
