Issue #227: [claude-fix] Fix routing: /api/migrate-semantic returns repo-snapshot instead of migration handler

Issue Description:
## Problem
The endpoint `/api/migrate-semantic` is returning the repo-snapshot output instead of executing the migration handler in `api/routes/migrate-semantic.js`.

## Root Cause
The route registration in `server.js` is likely missing or the repo-snapshot route is catching all `/api/*` requests before specific routes are matched.

## Required Fix
1. In `server.js`, add explicit route registration for the migration endpoint BEFORE any catch-all routes:
```javascript
import migrateSemanticHandler from "./api/routes/migrate-semantic.js";

// Add this BEFORE repoSnapshotRoute or any catch-all
app.get('/api/migrate-semantic', migrateSemanticHandler);
```

2. Ensure the route order in server.js follows this pattern:
   - Specific routes first (like `/api/migrate-semantic`)
   - Catch-all routes last (like repo-snapshot)

## Verification
After fix, hitting `https://sitemonkeys-ai-system-production.up.railway.app/api/migrate-semantic` should return JSON with `steps` array showing database migration progress, NOT a `files` array with repo contents.

## Files to modify
- `server.js` - Add route registration for migrate-semantic
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
