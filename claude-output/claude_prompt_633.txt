Issue #633: [claude-fix] Fix Memory Storage for Authoritative Validators

Issue Description:
## Problem
Authoritative validators execute but can't find the data they need.

### Evidence from logs:

1. **B3 Ordinal:** `found=false` — memories lack `metadata.ordinal_subject`
2. **INF3 Temporal:** `db_rows=1` but `duration=null` — content doesn't match extraction patterns  
3. **STR1 Vehicle:** No logs — validator not triggering at all
4. **NUA1 Ambiguity:** `db_rows=1` — only finding 1 of 2 Alex memories

## Fixes Needed

### 1. Ordinal Storage
When user says "My first code is X" and "My second code is Y", storage must set:
- `metadata.ordinal = 1` and `metadata.ordinal_subject = 'code'` and `metadata.ordinal_value = 'X'`
- `metadata.ordinal = 2` and `metadata.ordinal_subject = 'code'` and `metadata.ordinal_value = 'Y'`

### 2. Temporal Storage  
Ensure content contains extractable patterns like:
- "worked 5 years" or "for 5 years" or "spent 5 years"
- "left in 2020" or "until 2020" or "ended 2020"

### 3. Vehicle Validator
Debug why validator isn't logging. Check gating condition.

### 4. Check why only 1 Alex memory found
Two separate "Alex" memories should both be returned by query.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
