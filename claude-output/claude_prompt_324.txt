Issue #324: [claude-fix] Issue: Actually integrate Phase 4 pipeline into chat flow

Issue Description:
Context: PR #321 created Phase 4/5 components and doctrineEnforcer.js but left chat flow integration as "manual steps." The components exist but are never called during /api/chat requests. This is why Phase 4 metadata shows undefined.
Task: Complete the integration that was left undone:

Find api/lib/ai-processors.js (or wherever processWithEliAndRoxy lives)
Import Phase 4 components at top:

javascriptimport { detectTruthType } from '../core/intelligence/truthTypeDetector.js';
import { route } from '../core/intelligence/hierarchyRouter.js';
import { lookup } from '../core/intelligence/externalLookupEngine.js';
import { enforceAll } from '../core/intelligence/doctrineEnforcer.js';

BEFORE AI generation, add Phase 4 pipeline call
AFTER AI generation, add Phase 5 enforcement gates
Attach Phase 4 metadata to response so it appears in the response object

The previous PR (#321) provided the exact code to add in its summary - it just needs to be actually inserted into the file.
Acceptance: When calling /api/chat with "What is the current price of Bitcoin?", the response metadata includes:

truth_type: 'VOLATILE'
source_class: 'external' or 'internal'
verified_at: [timestamp]
external_lookup: true
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
