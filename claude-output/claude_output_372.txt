Excellent! The changes have been successfully applied. Now let me verify the logic by testing the patterns mentally:

1. **Pattern 1** (line 14): `/^what (is|are) \d+\s*([\+\-\*×÷\/x]|times|plus|minus|divided by|multiplied by)\s*\d+/i`
   - This will match: "What is 456 times 789", "What is 456 * 789", "What are 10 plus 20", etc.

2. **Pattern 2** (line 15): `/^\d+\s*(times|plus|minus|divided by|multiplied by|[\+\-\*×÷\/x])\s*\d+/i`
   - This will match: "456 times 789", "10 plus 20", "100 * 5", etc.

Both patterns now support:
- Word operators: "times", "plus", "minus", "divided by", "multiplied by"
- Symbol operators: +, -, *, ×, ÷, /, x

The fix is complete and matches the requirements in the issue exactly.

---SUMMARY---
Fixed Issue #372 by updating the `isSimpleFactualQuery()` function in both personality framework files to recognize word-based math operators in addition to symbol operators.

**Files Modified:**
1. `/api/core/personalities/eli_framework.js` (lines 12-22)
2. `/api/core/personalities/roxy_framework.js` (lines 12-22)

**Changes Made:**
- **Expanded Pattern 1**: Updated the existing math pattern from `/^what (is|are) \d+\s*[\+\-\*×÷\/x]\s*\d+/i` to `/^what (is|are) \d+\s*([\+\-\*×÷\/x]|times|plus|minus|divided by|multiplied by)\s*\d+/i` to include word operators alongside symbol operators.

- **Added Pattern 2**: Added a new standalone pattern `/^\d+\s*(times|plus|minus|divided by|multiplied by|[\+\-\*×÷\/x])\s*\d+/i` to catch math queries that start directly with numbers (e.g., "456 times 789").

**Result:**
The system will now correctly identify queries like "What is 456 times 789?" as simple factual queries, preventing the personality framework header ("Analytical framework applied") from being added to the response. The function now recognizes both symbol-based operators (+, -, *, ×, ÷, /, x) and word-based operators (times, plus, minus, divided by, multiplied by).

**Testing:**
The acceptance test provided in the issue should now pass:
- Query: "What is 456 times 789?"
- Expected: No "Analytical framework applied" header, just the answer (359,784)
