Issue #234: [claude-fix] Fix embedding-service.js - add node-fetch and AbortController imports

Issue Description:
## Problem
Server fails to start because embedding-service.js uses browser globals that don't exist in Node.js:
- 'fetch' is not defined (line 61)
- 'AbortController' is not defined (line 58)

## Fix Required
At the top of api/services/embedding-service.js (or api/routes/embedding-service.js), add:
```javascript
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
```

Note: AbortController is global in Node 18+, but fetch is not. If node-fetch isn't installed, use the native fetch with:
```javascript
const fetch = globalThis.fetch || (await import('node-fetch')).default;
```

Or simply use dynamic import inside the function.

## Files to modify
- api/services/embedding-service.js OR api/routes/embedding-service.js (whichever location it's in)
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
