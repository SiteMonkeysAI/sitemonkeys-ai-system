Issue #396: [claude-fix]  Title: External Lookup Pattern Matching Too Narrow - News Queries Failing

Issue Description:
Doctrine Reference: Phase 4 Technical Specification - "Automatic Lookup Triggers (Non-Negotiable)"
Problem: Queries about current political events fail to trigger external lookup unless they contain explicit freshness markers like "today" or "current". The pattern matcher should recognize:

Political figure names as news triggers
Words like "situation", "happening", "news" as freshness indicators
Geopolitical context (countries + political topics)

Evidence:

✅ "what's happening today with Venezuela" → lookup performed
❌ "green situation with Trump" → "No reliable parseable source"

Required behavior: Both queries should trigger external lookup and return Google News RSS results.
Test criteria:
Query: "What's the situation with Trump and Greenland"
Expected log: [externalLookupEngine] Performing lookup...
Expected log: [externalLookupEngine] Sources: Google New
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
