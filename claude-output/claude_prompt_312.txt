Issue #312: [claude-fix] Issue: Add test endpoint for ttlCacheManager.js

Issue Description:
Context: Phase 4 ttlCacheManager.js has been created at /api/core/intelligence/ttlCacheManager.js. Need a test endpoint to verify it works.
Task:

Find the routes file (same one where truthTypeDetector endpoint was added)
Add import for testCache from ttlCacheManager.js
Add test endpoint at /api/test-semantic/cache

Acceptance: Endpoint responds at /api/test-semantic/cache with cache operations working.
Test after deploy:

/api/test-semantic/cache?action=stats → returns cache statistics
/api/test-semantic/cache?action=set&q=Bitcoin%20price&data=50000&truthType=VOLATILE → stores entry
/api/test-semantic/cache?action=get&q=Bitcoin%20price → retrieves entry
/api/test-semantic/cache?action=fingerprint&q=current%20BTC%20price → shows normalized fingerprint
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
