Issue #316: [claude-fix] Issue: Add hierarchy action to test-semantic router

Issue Description:
Context: Phase 4 hierarchyRouter.js has been created at /api/core/intelligence/hierarchyRouter.js. Need to add it to the consolidated action router.
Task:

Add import for testRouting from hierarchyRouter.js
Add action=hierarchy handler that calls testRouting with query and mode params

Test after deploy:

/api/test-semantic?action=hierarchy&q=What%20is%20our%20minimum%20pricing → BUSINESS_POLICY, VAULT_FIRST
/api/test-semantic?action=hierarchy&q=What%20is%20the%20current%20price%20of%20Bitcoin → OBJECTIVE_FACTUAL, EXTERNAL_FIRST
/api/test-semantic?action=hierarchy&q=What%20is%20our%20pricing&mode=site_monkeys → BUSINESS_POLICY, VAULT_FIRST

Acceptance: Endpoint returns claim_type, hierarchy, and external_lookup_required for all test queries.
