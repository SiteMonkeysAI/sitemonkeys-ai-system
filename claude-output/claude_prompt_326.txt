Issue #326: [claude-fix] Issue: Phase 4/5 chat flow integration code missing from ai-processors.js

Issue Description:
Context: All Phase 4/5 components are operational (phase4-status shows all green), but chat_flow_integration: 'pending'. The actual code to CALL these components from processWithEliAndRoxy was never inserted.
Task: In /api/lib/ai-processors.js, inside the processWithEliAndRoxy function, add the Phase 4 pipeline BEFORE AI generation and Phase 5 enforcement AFTER AI generation. Import the four Phase 4 modules at top. Attach phase4_metadata and phase5_enforcement to the return object.
The imports needed:

detectTruthType from ../core/intelligence/truthTypeDetector.js
route from ../core/intelligence/hierarchyRouter.js
lookup from ../core/intelligence/externalLookupEngine.js
enforceAll from ../core/intelligence/doctrineEnforcer.js

Phase 4 (BEFORE AI call): Call detectTruthType, then route, then lookup if external_lookup_required. Store results in phase4Data object.
Phase 5 (AFTER AI response): Call enforceAll with the response and phase4Data. If response was modified by gates, use the corrected version.
Add to return object: phase4_metadata: phase4Data and phase5_enforcement: phase5Enforcement
Log markers: Use [PHASE4] 🔍 and [PHASE5] 🛡️ so we can see it in Railway logs.
Acceptance: Chat response includes populated phase4_metadata with truth_type, source_class, verified_at, and phase5_enforcement with enforcement_passed and gate_results.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
