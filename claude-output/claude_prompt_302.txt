Issue #302: [claude-fix] Fix ensureTablesExist export in document-service.js

Issue Description:
## Problem

The test-document-ingestion endpoint fails with:
```
"error": "ensureTablesExist is not a function"
```

## Likely Cause

Either:
1. `ensureTablesExist` is not exported from `/api/services/document-service.js`
2. The import in `/api/routes/test-semantic.js` is incorrect

## Fix

### In `/api/services/document-service.js`

Ensure the function is exported:
```javascript
export async function ensureTablesExist(pool) {
  if (!tablesInitialized) {
    await initializeDocumentTables(pool);
    tablesInitialized = true;
  }
}
```

Make sure `export` keyword is present.

### In `/api/routes/test-semantic.js`

Verify the import includes `ensureTablesExist`:
```javascript
case 'test-document-ingestion': {
  const { 
    ensureTablesExist,
    storeDocument, 
    searchDocuments, 
    getUserDocuments, 
    deleteDocument, 
    getDocumentStatus 
  } = await import('../services/document-service.js');
  
  // First call to ensure tables exist
  await ensureTablesExist(pool);
  
  // ... rest of test code
}
```

## Acceptance Test
```javascript
fetch("https://sitemonkeys-ai-system-production.up.railway.app/api/test-semantic?action=test-document-ingestion", {
  headers: { "X-Internal-Test-Token": "sitemonkeys-fullcheck-abc123" }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => {
  console.log("Document Ingestion:", d.summary, d.passed ? "✅" : "❌");
});
// Expected: 6/6 tests passed ✅
```
Your task is to:
