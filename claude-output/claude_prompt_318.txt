Issue #318: [claude-fix] Issue: Add external-lookup action to test-semantic router and integrate Phase 4 components

Issue Description:
Context: All four Phase 4 files are now created:

/api/core/intelligence/truthTypeDetector.js ✅
/api/core/intelligence/ttlCacheManager.js ✅
/api/core/intelligence/hierarchyRouter.js ✅
/api/core/intelligence/externalLookupEngine.js ✅

Need to add the external-lookup test endpoint and ensure all components are integrated.
Task:

Add import for testLookup from externalLookupEngine.js
Add action=external-lookup handler that calls testLookup with query param
Verify all Phase 4 actions are registered: truth-type, cache, hierarchy, external-lookup

Test after deploy:

/api/test-semantic?action=external-lookup&q=What%20is%20the%20current%20price%20of%20Bitcoin → lookup_performed: true, truth_type: VOLATILE
/api/test-semantic?action=external-lookup&q=What%20are%20the%20side%20effects%20of%20aspirin → high_stakes: MEDICAL, lookup_performed: true
/api/test-semantic?action=external-lookup&q=What%20is%20the%20Pythagorean%20theorem → lookup_performed: false (PERMANENT, no triggers)

Acceptance: All four Phase 4 test actions work and return expected results.
