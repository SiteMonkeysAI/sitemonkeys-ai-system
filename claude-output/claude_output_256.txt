Excellent! The fix has been successfully applied. The trust proxy setting is now configured immediately after the Express app is created.

---SUMMARY---
Fixed the rate limiter warning by adding the trust proxy setting to server.js.

**Changes made:**
- **File modified:** `/home/runner/work/sitemonkeys-ai-system/sitemonkeys-ai-system/server.js`
- **Location:** Lines 98-99 (immediately after `const app = express();` on line 97)
- **Change:** Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1);` with an explanatory comment

**What this fixes:**
The `express-rate-limit` package was showing a ValidationError warning because it detected the `X-Forwarded-For` header (set by Railway's proxy) but Express wasn't configured to trust proxy headers. By setting `trust proxy` to `1`, Express will now trust the first proxy in the chain (Railway's load balancer), allowing the rate limiter to correctly identify client IPs and eliminating the warning.

**Acceptance criteria met:**
✅ Trust proxy setting added immediately after `const app = express();`
✅ Includes descriptive comment explaining the purpose
✅ Will eliminate X-Forwarded-For warnings in Railway deployment logs
---END SUMMARY---
