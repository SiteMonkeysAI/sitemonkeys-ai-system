Both diagnostic test files are already correct! They both expect 2015 from the calculation 2020 - 5 = 2015.

Given that:
1. No file in the repository contains "reasonsTemporally"
2. Both diagnostic test files already have the correct 2020 - 5 = 2015 scenario
3. The issue description says to search for "reasonsTemporally" to find a file that wasn't updated

**Conclusion: The issue description appears to be outdated or incorrect. The test files have already been updated in PR #754. There is no file with "reasonsTemporally" that needs updating.**

However, let me create a summary explaining what I found and confirming that the tests are already correct:

---SUMMARY---

## Investigation Results

I conducted a thorough search of the entire repository for the main SMDEEP test file mentioned in issue #757. Here's what I found:

### Files Searched:
1. **diagnostic-tests-smdeep-complete.js** - The main browser console test file that outputs "Passed: X/15"
2. **diagnostic-tests-smdeep.js** - Another diagnostic test file
3. **collect-proof-bundles.js** - Proof collection script
4. **test-validator-enforcement.js** - Unit test file
5. All HTML, JS files in public/, locked-ui/, and root directories

### Search Methods Used:
- Searched for "reasonsTemporally" across all files (found ZERO matches in actual codebase, only in claude-output/)
- Searched for "INF3" test patterns
- Searched for "~2015" and "2015" expectations
- Searched for "Passed.*15" output patterns

### Key Findings:

**ALL TEST FILES ARE ALREADY CORRECT:**

1. **diagnostic-tests-smdeep-complete.js** (lines 130-156):
   - ✅ Stores: "I worked at Amazon for 5 years"
   - ✅ Stores: "I left Amazon in 2020"  
   - ✅ Asks: "When did I start working at Amazon?"
   - ✅ Expects: 2015 (from 2020 - 5 = 2015)
   - ✅ NO TechFlow/Google contamination

2. **diagnostic-tests-smdeep.js** (lines 270-319):
   - ✅ Same clean scenario: Amazon, 5 years, 2020, expects 2015
   - ✅ NO TechFlow/Google contamination

3. **test-validator-enforcement.js** (lines 87-120):
   - Uses 2019 - 5 = 2014 for its unit tests (different scenario, but internally consistent)

### Conclusion:

**The issue description appears to be outdated.** There is NO file in the repository that:
- Contains the string "reasonsTemporally"
- Expects ~2015 with incorrect setup
- Was missed by PR #754

All SMDEEP test files already use the correct scenario specified in the issue:
- Store "I worked at Amazon for 5 years"
- Store "I left Amazon in 2020"
- Ask "When did I start working at Amazon?"
- Expect 2015 (2020 - 5 = 2015)

**No changes were made** because no files requiring updates were found. The tests are already aligned with the requirements.
