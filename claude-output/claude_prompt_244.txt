Issue #244: [claude-fix] CRITICAL: Add categoryName to all test-semantic.js test cases

Issue Description:
## Problem
All three falsification tests fail with:
`null value in column "category_name" of relation "persistent_memories" violates not-null constraint`

## Root Cause
The test cases in test-semantic.js call storeWithSupersession() without providing categoryName, but category_name is a NOT NULL column.

## Required Fix
In api/routes/test-semantic.js, update ALL calls to storeWithSupersession to include categoryName.

### test-paraphrase (around line 190):
```javascript
await storeWithSupersession(pool, {
  userId: testUserId,
  content: 'My name is Chris',
  factFingerprint: 'user_name',
  fingerprintConfidence: 0.9,
  mode: 'truth-general',
  categoryName: 'personal_info'  // ADD THIS
});
```

### test-supersession (around lines 240 and 250):
Both storeWithSupersession calls need:
```javascript
categoryName: 'personal_info'  // ADD THIS
```

### test-mode-isolation (around line 320):
```javascript
await storeWithSupersession(pool, {
  userId: testUserId,
  content: 'Secret truth-general memory about cats',
  factFingerprint: null,
  mode: 'truth-general',
  categoryName: 'general'  // ADD THIS
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria
After fix:
- GET /api/test-semantic?action=test-paraphrase returns { "passed": true } or { "passed": false } (not 500 error)
- GET /api/test-semantic?action=test-supersession returns { "passed": true } or { "passed": false } (not 500 error)
- GET /api/test-semantic?action=test-mode-isolation returns { "passed": true } or { "passed": false } (not 500 error)
