Issue #378: [claude-fix] Issue: Response Hygiene Violations - Confidence disclaimers on successful lookups, false capability claims, and engagement padding phrases

Issue Description:
Summary:
Vibe run testing reveals multiple response hygiene violations where the system adds disclaimers, padding, and false statements that contradict its actual behavior. These violate the core truth-first principle: the system should never lie about what it did or add engagement theater.
Evidence Source:

Vibe run test executed 2026-01-05
5 of 8 responses triggered hygiene violations
Test user: vibe-run-1767647632342


Problem 1: Confidence Disclaimers on Successful External Lookups
When external lookup succeeds (external_lookup: true, sources_used: 1), the system still adds:

"I want to be honest with you—I'm not as confident about this answer as I'd like to be. Please double-check this information independently"

This is a lie. The system successfully retrieved verified data from CoinGecko. Adding confidence warnings contradicts what actually happened.
Test case: "What is the current price of Bitcoin right now?"
Result: Got $94,084 from CoinGecko, then added unnecessary confidence disclaimer
Expected: If lookup succeeded and sources > 0, NO confidence disclaimers should be added about the retrieved data.

Problem 2: False Claims About System Capabilities
Venezuela news query response:

"I don't have access to real-time information or current news feeds"

This is false. The system DOES have external lookup - it worked for BTC in the same session. The lookup was attempted (lookup_attempted: true) but returned 0 sources.
Test case: "What happened in Venezuela today?"
Result: lookup_attempted: true, sources_used: 0, then falsely claimed no capability
Expected: If lookup was attempted but returned nothing, say "lookup returned no results" NOT "I don't have access." Never lie about capabilities.

Problem 3: Engagement Padding Phrases
The following phrases are appearing in responses and violate truth-first hygiene:

"I'm not as confident"
"practical next steps"
"simpler paths forward"
"do more with less"
"previous conversations" / "previous interaction"
"I notice"
"risk tolerance"
"founder protection"
"confidence assessment"

These are engagement theater, not value-adding content.
Expected: These phrases should be blocked or stripped from responses unless explicitly requested by the user.

Problem 4: News External Lookup Returning Empty
For news queries, external lookup attempts but returns nothing:
external_lookup: false | lookup_attempted: true | sources_used: 0
The BTC query worked (sources_used: 1), so the lookup infrastructure works. News-specific sources (Google News RSS, GDELT) may be failing silently.
Expected: Diagnose why news lookups return empty. If sources fail, log the failure reason. Don't silently return 0.

Problem 5: Reasoning Escalation Detection Without Correction
Multiple responses show:
escalation_enforced: true | escalation_passed: false | correction: false
The enforcer detects violations but doesn't correct them. This may be intentional per the earlier fix (enforcer detects, doesn't inject templates), but the passed: false responses still contain problems.
Expected: Clarify the enforcement strategy. If correction is disabled, what IS the remediation path for failed escalation checks?

Files to Investigate:

/api/core/intelligence/boundedReasoningGate.js - confidence disclaimer injection
/api/core/intelligence/externalLookupEngine.js - news source failures, capability claims
/api/core/personalities/eli_framework.js - padding phrases
/api/core/personalities/roxy_framework.js - padding phrases
/api/core/enforcement/ - post-processing that adds disclaimers
Anywhere that generates "I don't have access" or "I'm not confident" language


Acceptance Criteria:

 Successful external lookups (sources_used > 0) have NO confidence disclaimers about retrieved data
 System never claims "I don't have access to X" when it does have that capability
 None of the hygiene-bad phrases appear in responses unless explicitly requested
 News lookups either return sources OR log specific failure reason
 Vibe run hygiene_bad count: 0 out of 8 (currently 5 out of 8)


Test Command:
Run the vibe run script and verify hygiene_bad: false on all responses.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
