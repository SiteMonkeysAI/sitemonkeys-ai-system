Issue #258: [claude-fix] Pass database pool to orchestrator for semantic retrieval

Issue Description:
## Problem
Production chat uses keyword fallback instead of semantic retrieval:
`[ORCHESTRATOR ERROR] [MEMORY] No database pool available, using keyword fallback`

The semantic layer tests pass, but /api/chat doesn't use semantic retrieval because the orchestrator doesn't have access to the database pool.

## Root Cause
In api/core/orchestrator.js, the #retrieveMemoryContext method tries to use semantic retrieval but fails because `this.pool` is undefined.

## Required Fix
1. In server.js, when creating the orchestrator, pass the database pool:

Find where orchestrator is created/initialized and ensure it receives the pool:
```javascript
// The pool should be passed to orchestrator
orchestrator.setPool(pool);
// OR passed in constructor
```

2. In api/core/orchestrator.js, ensure the pool is stored and accessible:
```javascript
setPool(pool) {
  this.pool = pool;
}
```

3. Verify the pool is available before calling semantic retrieval in #retrieveMemoryContext

## Acceptance Criteria
- No more "No database pool available" errors
- Response metadata shows `retrieval.method: "semantic"` instead of `"keyword_fallback"`
- Semantic retrieval telemetry appears in response
```
