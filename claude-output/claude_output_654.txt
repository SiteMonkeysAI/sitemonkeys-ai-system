Based on my thorough analysis:

1. **The issue has already been fixed**: PR #652 (commit c34b09de) already fixed the exact syntax error described in issue #654
2. **Current state is correct**: The `else` block is properly placed at lines 161-163, correctly paired with the `if (metadata.anchors)` block that starts at line 118
3. **No misplaced else block**: There is no stray `else` block after line 211 (in the number extraction section)

The file structure is correct:
- Lines 118-160: `if (metadata.anchors) { ... }` - processes metadata anchors
- Lines 161-163: `} else { ... }` - logs when no metadata.anchors
- Lines 165-213: Fallback extraction (runs for all memories)

Since the code is already correct and this appears to be a duplicate issue (issue #652 already fixed this), there are no changes needed.

---SUMMARY---
**Issue Status: Already Fixed**

Upon investigation, issue #654 describes a syntax error that was introduced by PR #651 and **already fixed by PR #652** (commit c34b09de with message "Fix syntax error in anchor-preservation.js line 211 — unexpected 'else'").

**The Problem (from PR #651):**
The `else` block for logging when `metadata.anchors` doesn't exist was incorrectly placed after line 213 (after the number extraction loop), instead of being paired with the `if (metadata.anchors)` statement at line 118.

**The Fix (already in PR #652):**
The `else` block was moved to its correct location at lines 161-163, immediately after the closing brace of the `if (metadata.anchors)` block.

**Current File State (api/lib/validators/anchor-preservation.js):**
- Lines 118-160: `if (metadata.anchors) { ... }` - correctly processes metadata anchors
- Lines 161-163: `} else { ... }` - correctly logs when no metadata.anchors exist  
- Lines 165-213: Fallback extraction code (runs for all memories regardless)
- Line 214: Closing brace for the memory loop

**Verification:**
- The else block is at line 161 (correct location)
- There is no misplaced else block after line 211/213
- The brace structure is properly matched
- The syntax is valid

**No changes were needed** - the current HEAD (commit af966c8a) already contains the fix from PR #652. Issue #654 appears to be a duplicate of issue #652.
