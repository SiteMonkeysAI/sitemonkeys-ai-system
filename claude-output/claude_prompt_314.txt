Issue #314: [claude-fix] Issue: Consolidate Phase 4 test endpoints into existing action router

Issue Description:
Context: Phase 4 test endpoints were created as separate routes (/api/test-semantic/truth-type and /api/test-semantic/cache). This creates drift from the existing test harness pattern which uses /api/test-semantic?action=.... Need to consolidate.
Task:

Find where the Phase 4 test routes were added
Remove the separate route patterns (/api/test-semantic/truth-type and /api/test-semantic/cache)
Add them as actions in the existing /api/test-semantic?action=... router instead:

action=truth-type&q=... for truth type detection
action=cache&... for cache operations


Update truthTypeDetector.js: Change Stage 2 default from SEMI_STABLE to VOLATILE (conservative default when AI classifier not integrated)

The consolidated actions should be:

/api/test-semantic?action=truth-type&q=What%20is%20the%20current%20price%20of%20Bitcoin
/api/test-semantic?action=cache&action=stats
/api/test-semantic?action=cache&q=Bitcoin%20price&data=50000&truthType=VOLATILE

Critical fix in truthTypeDetector.js:
In the classifyAmbiguous function, change the default return from SEMI_STABLE to VOLATILE (two places - the success return and the error catch return).
Acceptance:

No separate /api/test-semantic/truth-type or /api/test-semantic/cache routes exist
All Phase 4 tests work via ?action=truth-type and ?action=cache
Ambiguous queries default to VOLATILE, not SEMI_STABLE
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
