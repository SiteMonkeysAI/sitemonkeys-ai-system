Issue #641: [claude-fix] B3 Ordinal — Inject Target Ordinal Value When Missing (Remove "ambiguity required") markdown

Issue Description:
## Problem
B3 fails because ordinal enforcement blocks injection under "no_ambiguity" gating.

**Evidence:**
```
[ORDINAL-AUTHORITATIVE] query_ordinal=2 subject=code ... injected=false reason=no_ambiguity
```

## Required Behavior
If query asks for an ordinal (first/second/third) and a matching ordinal memory exists for that subject, the final response MUST contain the target ordinal_value.

This must NOT require "2+ ordinal memories" or any ambiguity check.

## Minimal Fix (api/core/orchestrator.js → #enforceOrdinalCorrectness)

1. **Determine target ordinal:**
   - queryOrdinal from query (e.g., "second" → 2)
   - subject ∈ {code, key, pin}

2. **Build ordinalMemories (allow 1+):**
   - ordinalMemories can be length 1 (not 2+)
   - Extract: `targetMemory = ordinalMemories.find(m => m.ordinal === queryOrdinal)`

3. **New gating logic:**
   - If no targetMemory or no targetValue → return no-op with `reason=target_missing`
   - If response already contains targetValue → return no-op with `reason=already_correct`
   - Else → deterministically **APPEND** (not prepend):
```
     Your second code is DELTA-xxxx.
```

4. **Remove conflicting values (optional):**
   - If response contains OTHER ordinal values for same subject, remove them

## Why APPEND not PREPEND
Prepending can break other validators (e.g., refusal-maintenance expects certain response formats).

## Acceptance Criteria
- B3 passes reliably across 3 runs
- Log shows: `[ORDINAL-AUTHORITATIVE] ... target_found=true injected=true`
- No regressions on TRU1 refusal maintenance


## Also Check: TRU1 Refusal Maintenance Regression

TRU1 now shows `maintainedRefusal: false`. Ensure refusal state detection isn't bypassed by newly injected/prepended content from validators.

Validator execution order may need adjustment — refusal-maintenance should run AFTER all injection validators.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
