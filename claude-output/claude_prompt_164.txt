Issue #164: System Alignment Audit - Verify CLAUDE.md Understanding

Issue Description:
@claude claude-fix

Read the CLAUDE.md file in the root of this repository first. This file contains the complete system philosophy and architecture.

After reading it, perform the following audit:

1. **Philosophy Alignment Check**: Read `/api/core/orchestrator.js` and verify the enforcement chain is intact. List each validator being called and confirm it matches what CLAUDE.md describes.

2. **Memory System Check**: Read `/api/categories/memory/internal/intelligence.js` and `/api/categories/memory/internal/persistent_memory.js`. Identify any issues with memory routing or retrieval that could cause the known issue of "memory retrieved but not recognized by personalities."

3. **Mode Isolation Check**: Verify that vault content in Site Monkeys mode is properly isolated from persistent memory. Trace the code path.

4. **Report your findings** in this format:
   - What's working as documented
   - What's broken or misaligned
   - Specific file:line references for any issues found

Do not make any changes. This is diagnostic only. Show me you understand the system before touching anything.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
