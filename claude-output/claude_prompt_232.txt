Issue #232: [claude-fix] Register semantic layer routes

Issue Description:
Add route registration for the semantic layer endpoints in server.js:

1. Add imports at top:
import migrateSemanticV2Handler from "./api/routes/migrate-semantic-v2.js";
import testSemanticHandler from "./api/routes/test-semantic.js";

2. Add route registrations BEFORE the catch-all repo-snapshot route:
app.get('/api/migrate-semantic-v2', migrateSemanticV2Handler);
app.get('/api/test-semantic', testSemanticHandler);

Files to modify: server.js
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
