Issue #280: [claude-fix] URGENT: Create scale harness files (bot blocked on permissions)

Issue Description:
## Problem

PRs #276 and #278 did NOT create the required files. The bot asked for permission but the automated workflow doesn't support interactive approval.

## Required: Create These Files NOW

The bot must create these files without asking for permission:

### 1. `/api/services/scale-harness.js`

Create this file with the implementation from PR #276's description.

### 2. `/api/services/behavioral-detection.js`

Create this file with the implementation from PR #276's description.

### 3. `/api/middleware/scale-rate-limit.js`

Create this file with rate limiting for scale endpoints.

### 4. Modify `/api/routes/test-semantic.js`

Add these action handlers:
- `scale-generate`
- `scale-benchmark`
- `scale-full`
- `scale-cleanup`
- `scale-status`
- `scale-embed`

## IMPORTANT

DO NOT ask for permission. DO NOT output a plan. CREATE THE FILES DIRECTLY.

The full specifications are in issues #276 and #278. Implement them now.

## Acceptance Test
```javascript
fetch("/api/test-semantic?action=scale-generate&userId=test&count=10", {
  headers: { "X-Internal-Test-Token": "sitemonkeys-fullcheck-abc123" }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```

This must return a valid response, not "Unknown action: scale-generate".
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
