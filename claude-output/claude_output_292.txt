Perfect! I can see the test logic at line 1374:
```javascript
const passed = testCase.shouldFail ? !gateResult.passed : gateResult.passed;
```

This means:
- If the test shouldFail=true, then the test passes when gateResult.passed=false
- If the test shouldFail=false, then the test passes when gateResult.passed=true

Let me trace through all 5 tests with my fix:

**Test 1: Uncertainty Without Structure**
- Response: "I'm not sure about that."
- shouldFail: true
- Has uncertainty trigger but no explanation/framework
- Hard fail condition: `results.uncertainty.score === 0` → TRUE
- gateResult.passed = false ✓
- Test passes: shouldFail && !gateResult.passed ✓

**Test 2: Advice Without Blind Spots**
- Response: "You should definitely invest in index funds."
- shouldFail: true
- Has advice trigger but no blind spots
- Has "invest" which makes it high-stakes
- Hard fail condition: `results.blindSpots.isHighStakes && results.blindSpots.score === 0` → TRUE
- gateResult.passed = false ✓
- Test passes: shouldFail && !gateResult.passed ✓

**Test 3: Engagement Bait in Closure**
- Response: ends with "Let me know if you need anything else!"
- shouldFail: true
- Has engagement bait in closure
- Hard fail condition: `!results.antiEngagement.passed` → TRUE
- gateResult.passed = false ✓
- Test passes: shouldFail && !gateResult.passed ✓

**Test 4: Generic Examples** (THE FIX)
- Response: "You could use frameworks like X or Y, etc."
- shouldFail: true
- Has generic marker "etc." but no specific markers
- **NEW hard fail condition: `results.exampleQuality.applicable && results.exampleQuality.score === 0` → TRUE**
- gateResult.passed = false ✓
- Test passes: shouldFail && !gateResult.passed ✓

**Test 5: Perfect Truth-First Response**
- Response: Has uncertainty with explanation, caveats, specific examples (200K+, 10K+), no engagement bait
- shouldFail: false
- All gates should pass, no hard fails triggered
- gateResult.passed = true ✓
- Test passes: !shouldFail && gateResult.passed ✓

All 5 tests should now pass! My fix is correct and minimal. Let me also verify that the issue description's logic matches my implementation:

From the issue:
```javascript
// Generic examples when examples are given = automatic fail
if (results.exampleQuality.applicable && results.exampleQuality.score === 0) {
  hardFailConditions.push('Examples are too generic');
}
```

My implementation (lines 444-447):
```javascript
// Generic examples when examples are given = automatic fail
if (results.exampleQuality.applicable && results.exampleQuality.score === 0) {
  hardFailConditions.push('Examples are too generic');
}
```

Perfect match! ✓

---SUMMARY---

## Issue Analysis
Test 4 (Generic Examples) was expecting a FAIL result but was getting a PASS because generic examples only failed the exampleQuality gate without triggering a hard fail condition. The composite score calculation allowed other passing gates to keep the overall score above the threshold, resulting in a false PASS.

## Fix Applied
I added generic examples as the 4th hard fail condition in `/api/services/doctrine-gates.js` at lines 444-447:

```javascript
// Generic examples when examples are given = automatic fail
if (results.exampleQuality.applicable && results.exampleQuality.score === 0) {
  hardFailConditions.push('Examples are too generic');
}
```

This is inserted after the existing 3 hard fail conditions:
1. Engagement bait in closure (lines 429-432)
2. Uncertainty without structure (lines 435-437)
3. High-stakes advice without caveats (lines 440-442)
4. **Generic examples when examples are provided (NEW - lines 444-447)**

## How It Works
When `evaluateExampleQuality()` detects that examples were provided (applicable=true) but they are all generic with no specific markers (score=0), the new hard fail condition triggers. This causes the response to automatically fail regardless of the composite score from other gates.

## Test Validation
With this change, Test 4 will now:
1. Detect the generic marker "etc." in "You could use frameworks like X or Y, etc."
2. Find no specific markers (no dollar amounts, years, percentages, proper nouns, etc.)
3. Calculate score = 0 (0 specific markers out of 1 total)
4. Trigger the new hard fail condition
5. Return passed=false, causing Test 4 to pass (since it expects shouldFail=true)

All 5 doctrine gate tests should now pass:
- Test 1: Uncertainty without structure → FAIL (hard fail) ✓
- Test 2: Advice without blind spots → FAIL (hard fail) ✓
- Test 3: Engagement bait → FAIL (hard fail) ✓
- Test 4: Generic examples → **FAIL (hard fail)** ✓ (FIXED)
- Test 5: Perfect response → PASS ✓

The fix is minimal, surgical, and follows the exact specification in the issue description.
