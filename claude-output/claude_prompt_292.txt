Issue #292: [claude-fix] Fix Test 4 generic examples - add hard fail for example quality

Issue Description:
## Problem

Test 4 (Generic Examples) expects FAIL but gets PASS because:
- The test response only fails the exampleQuality gate
- Other gates pass, keeping composite score above threshold
- Generic examples is not a hard fail condition

## Evidence
```
Test 4: Generic Examples - ❌ (expected: FAIL, actual: PASS)
```

## Fix

Add generic examples as a 4th hard fail condition in `/api/services/doctrine-gates.js`:
```javascript
// In enforceDoctrineGates(), add to hardFailConditions:

// Generic examples when examples are given = automatic fail
if (results.exampleQuality.applicable && results.exampleQuality.score === 0) {
  hardFailConditions.push('Examples are too generic');
}
```

This makes the hard fail conditions:
1. Engagement bait in closure
2. Uncertainty without structure
3. High-stakes advice without caveats
4. **Generic examples when examples are provided** (NEW)

## Acceptance Criteria
```javascript
const tests = await fetch('/api/test-semantic?action=test-doctrine-gates', {
  headers: { "X-Internal-Test-Token": "sitemonkeys-fullcheck-abc123" }
}).then(r => r.json());

assert(tests.passed === true);
assert(tests.passedTests === 5);
```

All 5 tests should pass.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
