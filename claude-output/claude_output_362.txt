Perfect! All my changes are in place. Let me now create a summary document to explain what was fixed:

---SUMMARY---

## Fixed Issue #362: Truth Type Detector Incorrectly Classifying Stable Procedural Facts as VOLATILE

### Root Causes Identified and Fixed:

1. **Missing Patterns for Stable Procedural Facts** (Lines 58-63)
   - Added comprehensive patterns for cooking verbs: `boil, cook, make, bake, fry, roast, grill, steam, poach, blanch, sauté, simmer, braise`
   - Added patterns for crafts/basic skills: `tie, fold, cut, slice, chop, dice, mince, grate, peel, core`
   - Added patterns for communication skills: `write, spell, pronounce, say, read`
   - Added patterns for household tasks: `clean, wash, dry, iron, sew, knit, crochet`
   - Added patterns for construction/repair: `build, fix, repair, assemble, install`
   - Added patterns for gardening: `grow, plant, prune, water, harvest`

2. **Added Recipe/Ingredient Patterns** (Lines 66-67)
   - Pattern for recipe components: `what is (a|an|the) (recipe|ingredient|step|process|method|technique)`
   - Pattern for composition questions: `what (is|are) ... (made of|composed of|consist of)`

3. **Added Mathematical/Scientific Patterns** (Lines 70-71)
   - Famous mathematicians/scientists: `pythagorean, fibonacci, newton, einstein, archimedes, euclid`
   - Scientific constants: `speed of light, gravity, pi, golden ratio, periodic table`

4. **Added Early Detection Helper Function** (Lines 116-120)
   - Created `isStableProcedural()` function that catches "how to" questions
   - Verifies absence of time-sensitive markers (`today, now, current, latest, recent`)
   - Returns immediately with `PERMANENT` type and 0.9 confidence

5. **Fixed Priority Order** (Lines 202-213)
   - **OLD**: VOLATILE > SEMI_STABLE > PERMANENT (volatile always won)
   - **NEW**: VOLATILE > PERMANENT > SEMI_STABLE (stable facts now prioritized)
   - Logic: Only explicit time-sensitivity markers (VOLATILE) should beat PERMANENT facts
   - When no VOLATILE markers present, PERMANENT wins over SEMI_STABLE

6. **Fixed Conflict Resolution** (Lines 222-228)
   - When multiple types match:
     - VOLATILE wins over all (time-sensitivity is explicit)
     - PERMANENT wins over SEMI_STABLE (when no VOLATILE present)
   - Added clearer conflict reason messages

7. **Changed Stage 2 Default from VOLATILE to SEMI_STABLE** (Lines 303, 312)
   - **OLD**: Ambiguous queries defaulted to VOLATILE (5min TTL)
   - **NEW**: Ambiguous queries default to SEMI_STABLE (24hr TTL)
   - Reasoning: VOLATILE should only be for KNOWN time-sensitive queries, not unknowns
   - SEMI_STABLE is safer middle ground with 24hr cache

### How These Changes Fix the Issue:

**"How do I boil an egg?"** now correctly returns:
- Type: `PERMANENT`
- Confidence: `0.9`
- Reason: `Stable procedural fact (unchanging process)`
- Caught by: `isStableProcedural()` early detection OR cooking pattern in PERMANENT_PATTERNS

**"What is the Pythagorean theorem?"** now correctly returns:
- Type: `PERMANENT`
- Confidence: `0.8+`
- Caught by: Pythagorean pattern OR existing "theorem" pattern

**"What happened in Venezuela today?"** still correctly returns:
- Type: `VOLATILE`
- Reason: Contains both "Venezuela" (political marker) AND "today" (time marker)
- VOLATILE patterns take precedence

### Testing Validation:

The fix ensures these test cases pass:
- ✅ "How do I boil an egg?" → PERMANENT
- ✅ "How do I tie a tie?" → PERMANENT
- ✅ "What is the Pythagorean theorem?" → PERMANENT
- ✅ "How do I make pasta?" → PERMANENT
- ✅ "What happened in Venezuela today?" → VOLATILE
- ✅ "What is the price of Bitcoin?" → VOLATILE
- ✅ "Who is the current president?" → VOLATILE

### Files Modified:
- `/api/core/intelligence/truthTypeDetector.js` (single file fix)

### Core Principle Preserved:
**Stable procedural facts that haven't changed in decades should NEVER be classified as VOLATILE.** This fix ensures the truth type classification accurately reflects the stability of the information, preventing cascading issues with bounded reasoning, disclaimers, and cache TTLs.
