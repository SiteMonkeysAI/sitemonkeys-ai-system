Issue #350: [claude-fix] Issue: External lookup trigger in orchestrator not using truth type or news patterns

Issue Description:
Context:

truthTypeDetector.js correctly classifies "Did the US attack Venezuela" as VOLATILE
externalLookupEngine.js correctly fetches data when called directly
But orchestrator.js is NOT triggering the lookup for these queries

The PR #348 fixed the VOLATILE pattern detection, but the orchestrator's decision to CALL the lookup engine is separate logic that wasn't updated.
Evidence:

"Venezuela" alone → lookup_attempted: true
"attack Venezuela" → lookup_attempted: false
"Did the US attack Venezuela" → lookup_attempted: false

Single words trigger lookup, but sentences don't - even after the truthTypeDetector fix.
Task: In /api/core/orchestrator.js, find where the external lookup decision is made and ensure it triggers when:

truthTypeResult.type === 'VOLATILE' (already should work but verify)
OR message matches news/geopolitical patterns directly:

javascriptconst shouldTriggerNewsLookup = /\b(venezuela|ukraine|russia|china|iran|israel|gaza|attack|election|president|war|invasion|military|conflict|strike|bombing|sanctions|crisis|coup|protest|news|breaking)\b/i.test(message);

if (truthTypeResult.type === 'VOLATILE' || shouldTriggerNewsLookup || routingResult.external_lookup_required) {
  // Trigger external lookup
  const lookupResult = await lookup(message, { ... });
}
Debug: Add logging to see WHY lookup isn't triggering:
javascriptconsole.log('[ORCHESTRATOR] Lookup decision:', {
  truthType: truthTypeResult.type,
  isVolatile: truthTypeResult.type === 'VOLATILE',
  routerRequiresLookup: routingResult.external_lookup_required,
  willAttemptLookup: ???
});
Acceptance:
ALL of these must return lookup_attempted: true:

"Venezuela"
"attack Venezuela"
"Did the US attack Venezuela"
"What is happening in Venezuela today"
"Venezuela news"
"Ukraine war update"
"Israel Gaza conflict"

This is NOT just about Venezuela - the system must trigger external lookup for ANY volatile news/geopolitical query.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
