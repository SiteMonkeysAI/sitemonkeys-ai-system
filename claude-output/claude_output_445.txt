Excellent! The fix is complete and correct. Let me create a summary:

---SUMMARY---

## Issue #445: Fixed "earlyClassification is not defined" ReferenceError

### Problem
The variable `earlyClassification` was defined in the `processRequest()` method (line 471) but was being referenced in the `#routeToAI()` method (line 2917) where it was not in scope, causing a ReferenceError that broke the entire system.

### Solution
Implemented Option A from the issue description by passing `earlyClassification` through the context object:

### Changes Made

**File: `/api/core/orchestrator.js`**

1. **Line 872-873** (before `#routeToAI` call):
   - Added comment: `// Add earlyClassification to context for system prompt (Issue #444 fix)`
   - Added: `context.earlyClassification = earlyClassification;`
   - This adds the early classification data to the context object before passing it to `#routeToAI`

2. **Line 2919** (inside `#routeToAI` method):
   - Changed: `const systemPrompt = this.#buildSystemPrompt(mode, analysis, context.reasoningGuidance, earlyClassification);`
   - To: `const systemPrompt = this.#buildSystemPrompt(mode, analysis, context.reasoningGuidance, context.earlyClassification);`
   - This accesses the classification from the context object instead of trying to use an out-of-scope variable

### Verification
- All other references to `earlyClassification` (lines 471, 474-476, 485-487, 490, 1141-1142) are within the `processRequest()` method scope and remain unchanged
- The fix follows the existing pattern of passing data through the context object
- This is a minimal, surgical fix with only 2 lines modified as specified in the issue

### Expected Result
- System should no longer throw "earlyClassification is not defined" error
- Requests should complete without emergency fallback
- Test pass rate should return to 81%+ baseline
