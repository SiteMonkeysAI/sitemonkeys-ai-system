Issue #322: [claude-fix] Issue: Fix Stage 2 default and verify route consolidation

Issue Description:
Context: Other AI review identified two corrections needed for Phase 4 to fully align with doctrine.
Task 1: Fix Stage 2 default in truthTypeDetector.js
In the classifyAmbiguous function, change BOTH return statements from SEMI_STABLE to VOLATILE:
javascript// Change this:
type: TRUTH_TYPES.SEMI_STABLE,

// To this:
type: TRUTH_TYPES.VOLATILE,
This applies to both the success return AND the catch block return.
Reason: Defaulting ambiguous queries to SEMI_STABLE (24hr cache) violates "no silent caching of volatile truth." If Stage 2 AI classification isn't fully integrated, the safest default is VOLATILE (5min cache) - conservative, not permissive.
Task 2: Verify route consolidation
Confirm all Phase 4 test actions use the unified pattern:

/api/test-semantic?action=truth-type
/api/test-semantic?action=cache
/api/test-semantic?action=hierarchy
/api/test-semantic?action=external-lookup

No separate route families like /api/test-semantic/truth-type.
Acceptance:

Ambiguous queries default to VOLATILE
All Phase 4 tests accessible only via ?action= pattern
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
