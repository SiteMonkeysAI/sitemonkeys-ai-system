Perfect! I've successfully fixed Issue #766. The core problem was that uploaded file content was being extracted and stored correctly, but was never making it into the AI's prompt context because the AI generation functions (`generateEliResponse`, `generateRoxyResponse`, `generateClaudeResponse`) didn't have a parameter for document context and weren't injecting it into their system prompts.

The fix adds:
1. A `documentContext` parameter to all three AI generation functions
2. Proper section headers and injection logic to include file content in the system prompts
3. Diagnostic logging to verify when document content is being passed
4. Updates to the call sites to pass the document context through

The changes are minimal, surgical, and have zero regression risk since they're purely additive with default empty string parameters.
