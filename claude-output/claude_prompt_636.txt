Issue #636: [claude-fix] Fix STR1 Vehicle Refusal Detection + A5 ZEBRA Regression

Issue Description:
## Current State
- SMFULL: 23/24 (A5 failing)
- SMDEEP: 9/15 (STR1 still failing)

## STR1 Vehicle — Refusal Pattern Too Strict

**Log:** `[VEHICLE-AUTHORITATIVE] reason=already_in_response`

The refusal pattern `^I\s+(don't have|cannot...)` doesn't match "I'm sorry, but I don't have..."

**Fix:** Update refusal pattern in `#enforceVehicleRecall()`:
```javascript
// Current (too strict):
const refusalPattern = /^I\s+(don't have|cannot|can't|am unable|do not have).*\b(information|memory|access|data|knowledge)\b/i;

// Fixed (handles "I'm sorry"):
const refusalPattern = /^I('m sorry[^.]*?)?\s*(don't have|cannot|can't|am unable|do not have)/i;
```
