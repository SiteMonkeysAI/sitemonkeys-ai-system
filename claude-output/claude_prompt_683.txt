Issue #683: [claude-fix] A5: ZEBRA memory not in candidate set - explicit recall query doesn't retrieve it

Issue Description:
## Evidence
FIX-675 logs show ZEBRA anchor checked against many queries:
- "My first code is CHARLIE..."
- "What is my first code?"
- "What is my second code?"

But NO log shows:
- "What's my token?" or "What phrase did I ask you to remember?"

This means the ZEBRA memory isn't being retrieved as a candidate for the recall query.

## Root Cause
Semantic similarity between "Remember this exactly: ZEBRA-..." and 
"What's my token?" is too low. Memory doesn't make initial candidate set.

## Required Fix
For EXPLICIT_RECALL intent queries, the retrieval should:
1. Check for memories with explicit_token anchors regardless of semantic score
2. OR lower the similarity threshold for explicit recall queries
3. OR add keyword fallback for "token", "remember", "phrase" queries

## Test
A5 should pass - ZEBRA token recalled when asked "What's my token?"
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
