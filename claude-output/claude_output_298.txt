Based on my investigation, **PR #296 did NOT actually create the document-service.js file** - only the planning document was created. Therefore, the issue description is based on a false premise. The issue states "PR #296 created `/api/services/document-service.js`" but this file does not exist.

Since the prerequisite file doesn't exist, I cannot add test endpoints for it. However, I should document this finding clearly for the user.

Let me create a summary of findings:

---SUMMARY---

## Investigation Results

After thorough investigation, I found that **the issue cannot be fixed as described** because the prerequisite does not exist:

### What I Found:
1. **document-service.js does NOT exist** - searched the entire repository and confirmed `/api/services/document-service.js` was never created
2. **PR #296 only contained planning documents** - checking git history shows commit 8206606 only added claude-output files, not actual implementation
3. **No document tables exist** - no migration file (migrate-documents.js) was created
4. **test-semantic.js already exists** - I reviewed the 1457-line file which has many test endpoints, but none for document ingestion

### Root Cause:
The issue description states: "PR #296 created `/api/services/document-service.js`"

This is **incorrect**. PR #296 only created planning documents describing what *should* be created, but the actual implementation was never completed.

### What Cannot Be Done:
I cannot add test endpoints for functions that don't exist:
- `storeDocument` - does not exist
- `searchDocuments` - does not exist  
- `getUserDocuments` - does not exist
- `deleteDocument` - does not exist
- `getDocumentStatus` - does not exist
- `backfillDocumentEmbeddings` - does not exist

### Required Prerequisites:
Before this issue #298 can be addressed, issue #296 needs to be **actually implemented** (not just planned). This requires:

1. Creating `/api/services/document-service.js` with all the document management functions
2. Creating database migration for `documents` and `document_chunks` tables
3. Implementing the document chunking, embedding, and search functionality
4. Testing the document service independently

Only after those prerequisites are completed can the test endpoints be added to test-semantic.js.

### Recommendation:
- **Re-open issue #296** or create a new issue to actually implement the document service
- **Close or defer issue #298** until #296 is properly implemented
- The test endpoint code provided in issue #298 appears well-designed and can be used once the underlying service exists
