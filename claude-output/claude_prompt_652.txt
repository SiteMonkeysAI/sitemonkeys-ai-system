Issue #652: [claude-fix] Fix syntax error in anchor-preservation.js line 211 — unexpected 'else'

Issue Description:
## Problem

PR #651 introduced a syntax error that crashes the server on startup:
```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'else'
    at anchor-preservation.js:211
```

## Root Cause

The `else` block added for telemetry logging doesn't have a matching `if` statement, or there's a brace mismatch.

## Fix

In `api/lib/validators/anchor-preservation.js`, find line ~208-211 and ensure the if/else structure is correct:
```javascript
// The structure should be:
if (metadata.anchors) {
  // ... existing anchor processing code ...
  console.log(`[ANCHOR-VALIDATOR] Memory ${memoryId}: anchors_keys=[${anchorKeys.join(', ')}]`);
} else {
  console.log(`[ANCHOR-VALIDATOR] Memory ${memoryId}: anchors_keys=[] (no metadata.anchors)`);
}
```

Check that:
1. The `if (metadata.anchors)` block has proper opening/closing braces
2. The `else` is directly after the closing brace of the `if`
3. No extra or missing braces in the surrounding code

## Acceptance Criteria

- Server starts without syntax errors
- Healthcheck passes
- Deployment succeeds
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue
