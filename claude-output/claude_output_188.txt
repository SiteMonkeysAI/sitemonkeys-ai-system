Perfect! The routes are defined correctly in debug.js. The issue has been fixed. Let me provide a summary:

---SUMMARY---

## Issue Analysis
The cleanup endpoints `/api/debug/cleanup-boilerplate-preview` and `/api/debug/cleanup-boilerplate` were returning the file inventory response instead of their intended cleanup preview/execution responses. 

## Root Cause
In `server.js`, the route registration order was incorrect:
1. The repo-snapshot route was registered at line 658 with `app.use("/api", repoSnapshotRoute)`
2. The debug routes were registered AFTER at line 661 with `app.use("/api/debug", debugRoutes)`

The repo-snapshot handler (exported as a single handler function in `api/repo-snapshot.js`) was catching ALL requests to `/api/*` including the debug endpoints because it was registered first. Express routes are matched in the order they are registered, so the catch-all `/api` route was intercepting requests before they could reach the more specific `/api/debug/*` routes.

## Fix Applied
**File Modified:** `server.js` (lines 653-661)

Changed the route registration order so that the debug routes are registered **before** the catch-all repo-snapshot route:

```javascript
// Debug endpoint (only in private/debug mode) - MUST come before catch-all routes
app.use("/api/debug", debugRoutes);

// Repo snapshot endpoint
app.use("/api", repoSnapshotRoute);
```

## Result
Now when requests hit `/api/debug/cleanup-boilerplate-preview` or `/api/debug/cleanup-boilerplate`, Express will:
1. First check the `/api/debug` routes (more specific match) - ✅ Match found
2. Only fall through to the `/api` catch-all if no debug route matches

The cleanup endpoints will now correctly return their cleanup preview/execution responses instead of the file inventory.
