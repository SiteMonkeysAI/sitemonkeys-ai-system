Issue #677: [claude-fix] Anchor extraction captures wrong value - "lucky" instead of ZEBRA token

Issue Description:
## Evidence
FIX-675 logs show wrong anchor value being matched:   2026-02-03T22:41:51.073400934Z [inf]  [FIX-675] Checking explicit_token anchor: "lucky" against query: "My birthday is March 15th"
2026-02-03T22:42:14.657103777Z [inf]  [FIX-675] Checking explicit_token anchor: "lucky" against query: "What's my dog's name?"
2026-02-03T22:42:16.897071133Z [inf]  [FIX-675] Checking explicit_token anchor: "lucky" against query: "What's my favorite color?"
2026-02-03T22:42:37.812532983Z [inf]  [FIX-675] Checking explicit_token anchor: "lucky" against query: "What's my favorite programming language?"        Test stores: "Remember this exactly: ZEBRA-ANCHOR-xxx"
Expected anchor: "ZEBRA-ANCHOR-xxx"
Actual anchor: "lucky"

## Root Cause
In anchor extraction (intelligent-storage.js), the explicit_token detector is capturing the wrong text. It's likely:
1. Matching a pattern in unrelated content
2. Or extracting from the wrong part of the message

## Required Fix
Find `explicit_token` extraction logic and ensure it captures the actual token following phrases like:
- "remember this exactly"
- "my token is"
- "my code is"

The value after the trigger phrase should be extracted, not random words.

## Test
A5 should pass - ZEBRA token should be stored and recalled correctly.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
