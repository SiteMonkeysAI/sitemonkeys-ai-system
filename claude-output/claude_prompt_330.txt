Issue #330: [claude-fix] Issue: Phase 4/5 metadata not included in orchestrator response object

Issue Description:
Context: Railway logs now show Phase 4 and Phase 5 executing correctly:

🔍 PHASE 4: Truth type detection and external lookup
[PHASE 4] Truth type: VOLATILE, confidence: 0.6
🛡️ PHASE 5: Applying doctrine enforcement gates
[doctrineEnforcer] Enforcement complete: PASSED

But the response returned to the client still has phase4_metadata: undefined and phase5_enforcement: undefined.
Task: In api/core/orchestrator.js, find where the response object is built and returned (likely in a return { success: true, response: ... } statement). Add phase4_metadata and phase5_enforcement to that return object.
The variables phase4Metadata and phase5Enforcement exist and are populated (we see them in logs). They just need to be included in the final return statement.
Acceptance: Chat response includes populated phase4_metadata and phase5_enforcement objects (not undefined).
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
