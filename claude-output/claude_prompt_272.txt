Issue #272: [claude-fix] Live-proof assertion checks wrong property path for method

Issue Description:
CRITICAL: One-line fix. Live-proof is functionally working but assertion is wrong.

## Current Status
All functionality works:
- Memory stored ✅
- Embedding generated ✅  
- Semantic retrieval found the memory ✅
- Response contains the fact ✅

But test fails because:
method_is_semantic_or_hybrid: false

## Root Cause
The test checks:
result.method === 'semantic'

But the actual structure is:
result.telemetry.method === 'semantic'

Logs prove this:
method: undefined,  // at top level
telemetry: {
  method: 'semantic',  // actual location
}

## Required Fix
In test-semantic.js live-proof action, change:

FROM:
method_is_semantic_or_hybrid: result.method === 'semantic' || result.method === 'hybrid'

TO:
method_is_semantic_or_hybrid: result.telemetry?.method === 'semantic' || result.telemetry?.method === 'hybrid'

## Verification
fetch('/api/test-semantic?action=live-proof', {headers:{'X-Internal-Test-Token':'...'}})
// Must return: { passed: true }
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
