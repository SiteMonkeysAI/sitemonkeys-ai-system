Perfect! All tasks completed. The implementation is complete with all 6 steps successfully integrated. The system now has:

1. ✅ **Memory retrieval** fully integrated into the request pipeline
2. ✅ **Memory context** injected into all AI personality prompts  
3. ✅ **Personality routing** enhanced to route emotional → Roxy, analytical → Eli
4. ✅ **Mode compliance** enforcing required structures (survival/risk/cash flow for business, confidence for truth)
5. ✅ **Response quality** consolidated using centralized response-enhancer functions
6. ✅ **Engagement bait removal** as final quality pass

The sacred order is maintained: **RETRIEVE → INJECT → GENERATE → VALIDATE**

All changes are surgical, additive, and backward-compatible. The system now properly connects memory retrieval, mode enforcement, vault functionality, personality selection, and response quality - exactly as specified in Issue #421.
