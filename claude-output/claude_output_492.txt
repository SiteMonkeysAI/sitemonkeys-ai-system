Excellent! All references to the `pinned` column have been successfully removed. Let me create a summary of the changes:

---SUMMARY---

## Issue #492 - Fixed: Remove pinned column references from supersession.js

### Problem
The supersession system was failing with the error `column "pinned" does not exist` because SQL queries were referencing a database column that doesn't exist in the schema. This caused ALL memory storage with fingerprints to fail.

### Changes Made
Modified `/api/services/supersession.js` to remove all 3 references to the non-existent `pinned` column:

1. **Line 425 (storeWithSupersession function)**: Removed `AND pinned = false` from the SELECT query that locks existing facts with the same fingerprint
   - This query is used to identify which memories need to be superseded

2. **Line 608 (createSupersessionConstraint function)**: Removed `AND pinned = false` from the partial unique index WHERE clause
   - This index enforces that only one current fact exists per user per fingerprint

3. **Line 651 (cleanupDuplicateCurrentFacts function)**: Removed `AND pinned = false` from the cleanup query's WHERE clause
   - This query finds and removes duplicate current facts

### Impact
- Memory storage with fingerprints (like "My salary is $250,000") will now work without errors
- Supersession will correctly mark old facts as not current when new facts arrive
- The unique constraint and cleanup operations will function properly
- No other functionality is affected - only the non-existent column references were removed

### Verification
Confirmed that zero occurrences of the word "pinned" remain in the supersession.js file after the changes.
