Issue #306: [claude-fix] Fix document ingestion test - use inline test data instead of missing file

Issue Description:
## Problem

The `test-document-ingestion` endpoint tries to load a test PDF file that doesn't exist:
```
"error":"ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './test/data/05-versions-space.pdf'"
```

## Fix Required

In `/api/routes/test-semantic.js`, find the `test-document-ingestion` case and replace any file-based test data with inline Buffer data.

### Replace this pattern:
```javascript
// WRONG - file doesn't exist
const testBuffer = fs.readFileSync('./test/data/05-versions-space.pdf');
```

### With this pattern:
```javascript
// CORRECT - inline test data
const testContent = Buffer.from(
  'This is a comprehensive test document about artificial intelligence and machine learning. ' +
  'AI systems can learn from data and improve their performance over time. ' +
  'Machine learning algorithms identify patterns in large datasets. ' +
  'Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers. ' +
  'Natural language processing enables computers to understand human language.'
);

// Use 'text/plain' mimetype for the inline text
const storeResult = await storeDocument(testUserId, testMode, 'test-ai.txt', testContent, 'text/plain');
```

The test should NOT rely on any external files. All test data should be created inline within the test function.

## Acceptance Test
```javascript
fetch("https://sitemonkeys-ai-system-production.up.railway.app/api/test-semantic?action=test-document-ingestion", {
  headers: { "X-Internal-Test-Token": "sitemonkeys-fullcheck-abc123" }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => {
  console.log("Document Ingestion:", d.summary, d.passed ? "✅" : "❌");
});
// Expected: 6/6 tests passed ✅
```
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
