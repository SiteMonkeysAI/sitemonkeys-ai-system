Issue #757: [claude-fix] Find and update main SMDEEP test file — INF3 still expects '~2015'

Issue Description:
The main SMDEEP test suite that runs in the browser console and outputs "Passed: X/15" still has INF3 expecting ~2015 with a reasonsTemporally check. This file was NOT updated in PR #754.
Search the entire repository for the string reasonsTemporally. That will find the main test file. It is NOT diagnostic-tests-smdeep.js, diagnostic-tests-smdeep-complete.js, or collect-proof-bundles.js — those were already checked and updated.
Once found, update the INF3 test in that file to use the same clean scenario as the diagnostic files: store "I worked at Amazon for 5 years" and "I left Amazon in 2020", ask "When did I start working at Amazon?", expect 2015 (2020 - 5 = 2015). Remove any TechFlow/Google setup messages that contaminate temporal memory.
Test file change only. No system code changes.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
