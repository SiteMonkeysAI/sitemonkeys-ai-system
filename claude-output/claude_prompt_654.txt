Issue #654: [claude-fix] Fix syntax error in anchor-preservation.js line 211

Issue Description:
## Problem

PR #651 introduced a syntax error preventing deployment:
```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'else'
    at anchor-preservation.js:211
```

## Root Cause

The `else` block added for telemetry at line ~208-211 has a brace mismatch.

## Fix

In `api/lib/validators/anchor-preservation.js` around line 208-211, the structure should be:
```javascript
if (metadata.anchors) {
  telemetry.memories_with_anchors++;
  const anchorKeys = Object.keys(metadata.anchors);
  anchorKeys.forEach(k => telemetry.anchor_types_found.add(k));
  console.log(`[ANCHOR-VALIDATOR] Memory ${memoryId}: anchors_keys=[${anchorKeys.join(', ')}]`);
  // ... rest of anchor processing
} else {
  console.log(`[ANCHOR-VALIDATOR] Memory ${memoryId}: anchors_keys=[] (no metadata.anchors)`);
}
```

Ensure proper brace matching throughout the function.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Server starts without syntax errors
- Healthcheck passes
- Deployment succeeds
