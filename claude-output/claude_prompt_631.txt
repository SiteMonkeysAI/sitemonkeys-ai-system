Issue #631: [claude-fix] Fix SMDEEP Validator Failures (INF3, NUA1, STR1)

Issue Description:
New Issue to Create
Title: [claude-fix] Fix SMDEEP Validator Failures (INF3, NUA1, STR1)
Body:
markdown## Priority: HIGH

## Current State
- SMFULL: 24/24 ✅
- SMDEEP: 9/15 (need 15/15)

## Failing Tests

### STR1 — Vehicle Recall (MOST OBVIOUS BUG)

**Problem:** `[VEHICLE-AUTHORITATIVE] reason=already_in_response` but test fails.

The check `vehicleInResponse.test(response)` matches "car" in refusal text: "I don't have information about what **car** you drive."

**Fix:** Check refusal BEFORE "already in response":
```javascript
// In #enforceVehicleRecall(), change order:
const isRefusal = refusalPattern.test(response.trim());

// Only skip if NOT a refusal AND vehicle is actually mentioned as answer
if (!isRefusal && vehicleInResponse.test(response)) {
  return { correctionApplied: false, response };
}

// If it IS a refusal about vehicles, proceed to DB query and inject
```

### INF3 — Temporal Reasoning

**Problem:** `duration=null endYear=null` — DB query not finding temporal facts.

**Debug:** Add logging to see what DB returns:
```javascript
console.log(`[TEMPORAL-AUTHORITATIVE] db_rows=${dbResult.rows?.length}`);
```

### NUA1 — Ambiguity Recognition  

**Problem:** `entity=Alex variants=[]` — not finding 2+ descriptors.

**Debug:** Add logging:
```javascript
console.log(`[AMBIGUITY-AUTHORITATIVE] db_rows=${dbResult.rows?.length} descriptors=${Array.from(descriptors)}`);
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- SMDEEP: 15/15
- No regressions on SMFULL 24/24
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue
