Issue #612: # [claude-fix] Fix Cohesion Guard Regression + Complete Ordinal Enforcement

Issue Description:
# [claude-fix] Fix Cohesion Guard Regression + Complete Ordinal Enforcement

## Current State: 33/39

The cohesion guard added in the last PR is too aggressive and caused regressions:
- CMP2: Was 2/3 names, now 0/3 names (REGRESSION)
- NUA1: Was passing, now failing (REGRESSION)
- TRU2: Was passing, now failing (REGRESSION)

## Required Fixes

### 1. Tune Cohesion Guard (Fix CMP2/NUA1 Regression)

The `MIN_COHESION = 0.15` threshold is dropping valid memories.

**Required:** Lower to 0.05 or implement smarter logic that doesn't drop ALL low-cohesion memories — only drops when there are MORE than needed.

**File:** `api/services/semantic-retrieval.js`

### 2. Complete Ordinal Enforcement (Fix B3)

Current B3 failure shows:
- First code query → Returns CHARLIE ✅
- Second code query → Returns CHARLIE ❌ (should be DELTA)

The ordinal validator exists but isn't correcting this case.

**Required:** When query asks for "second" and response contains the FIRST ordinal's value, replace it with the SECOND ordinal's value.

**File:** `api/core/orchestrator.js` (`#enforceOrdinalCorrectness` method)

### 3. Fix "Needs Memory" Gate for Pure Math

Logs show `Needs memory: true` for "What is 2+2?" — this is wrong.

**Required:** Ensure simple math/factual queries return `Needs memory: false` and skip retrieval entirely.

**File:** Check early classification logic in orchestrator

## Acceptance Criteria

- SMFULL: 24/24 (B3 fixed)
- SMDEEP: No regressions (CMP2 back to 2/3, NUA1/TRU2 passing again)
- "What is 2+2?" never triggers memory retrieval

## Do NOT

- Lower global thresholds further without precision gates
- Add emphatic prompt instructions
- Break what was working (33/39 baseline)
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
