Issue #308: [claude-fix] Fix pdf-parse import error and use inline test data for document ingestion

Issue Description:
## Problem

The `pdf-parse` npm package has a known bug - it tries to load a test file on import:
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './test/data/05-versions-space.pdf'
```

This happens at `/app/node_modules/pdf-parse/index.js:15:25` when the package is imported.

## Fix Required

### Option A: Lazy import (preferred)
In `/api/services/document-service.js`, change the pdf-parse import to be lazy/dynamic:
```javascript
// WRONG - imports on module load, triggers the bug
import pdf from 'pdf-parse';

// CORRECT - import only when needed
async function extractTextFromPDF(buffer) {
  const pdf = (await import('pdf-parse')).default;
  const data = await pdf(buffer);
  return data.text;
}
```

### Option B: Use pdf-parse/lib/pdf-parse.js directly
```javascript
// This path avoids the problematic index.js
import pdf from 'pdf-parse/lib/pdf-parse.js';
```

### Also fix test-semantic.js
In `/api/routes/test-semantic.js`, the `test-document-ingestion` case should use inline test data (plain text), NOT a PDF file:
```javascript
// Use plain text for testing - no PDF needed
const testContent = Buffer.from(
  'This is a test document about artificial intelligence. ' +
  'AI systems learn from data and improve over time.'
);
const result = await storeDocument(testUserId, testMode, 'test.txt', testContent, 'text/plain');
```

## Acceptance Test
```javascript
fetch("https://sitemonkeys-ai-system-production.up.railway.app/api/test-semantic?action=test-document-ingestion", {
  headers: { "X-Internal-Test-Token": "sitemonkeys-fullcheck-abc123" }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log(d.passed ? "✅" : "❌", d.summary));
```
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the issue carefully to understand the problem
2. Look through the repository to identify the relevant files that need to be modified
3. Make precise changes to fix the issue
4. Use the Edit tool to modify files directly when needed
5. Be minimal in your changes - only modify what's necessary to fix the issue

After making changes, provide a summary of what you did in this format:

---SUMMARY---
[Your detailed summary of changes, including which files were modified and how]
---END SUMMARY---

Remember:
- Be specific in your changes
- Only modify files that are necessary to fix the issue
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make the minimal changes needed to resolve the issue
