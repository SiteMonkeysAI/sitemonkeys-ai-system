Perfect! All changes have been successfully implemented. Let me create a summary of the changes:

---SUMMARY---

Successfully integrated the Reasoning Escalation Enforcer into the orchestrator enforcement chain as Phase 6.5, implementing Issue #374.

## Files Modified:

### `/api/core/orchestrator.js`

**1. Added Import Statement (Line 45):**
- Imported `enforceReasoningEscalation` from `./intelligence/reasoningEscalationEnforcer.js`
- Placed alongside other Phase 4/5/6/7 enforcement imports

**2. Added Phase 6.5 Enforcement Logic (Lines 848-876):**
- Inserted between Phase 6 (Bounded Reasoning) and Phase 7 (Response Contract)
- Enforcement only triggers when `phase6BoundedReasoning.required` is true
- Passes the response, phase6 metadata, and context to the enforcer
- Applies corrections if the enforcer generates improved response
- Logs violations and enforcement status
- Follows the same pattern as other enforcement phases

**3. Added Metadata Tracking - First Location (Line 1051):**
- Added `reasoning_escalation: reasoningEscalationResult` to the metadata object
- Placed after `phase6_bounded_reasoning` and before `response_contract`
- Provides internal metadata tracking for the enforcement results

**4. Added Metadata Tracking - Second Location (Line 1124):**
- Added `reasoning_escalation: reasoningEscalationResult` to the top-level response object
- Enables client-side access to reasoning escalation enforcement data
- Consistent with how other phase results are exposed

## Implementation Details:

The integration enforces the core invariant:
```
IF uncertainty exists AND truthful reasoning paths exist
THEN the system MUST attempt them before stopping
```

**Enforcement Flow:**
1. Phase 6 detects bounded reasoning requirement
2. Phase 6.5 checks if response contains escalation steps (known facts, unknowns, parallels, scenarios, confidence paths)
3. Detects premature termination markers ("I can't help", "consult a professional", etc.)
4. Validates minimum 3 of 5 reasoning steps were attempted
5. Applies deterministic corrections by appending missing reasoning templates if violations found
6. Logs all violations and corrections for monitoring

**Response Metadata Structure:**
```javascript
reasoning_escalation: {
  enforced: boolean,
  bounded_reasoning_required: boolean,
  escalation_check: {
    results: { /* which steps were found */ },
    attempted: string[],
    missing: object[],
    completedCount: number,
    totalSteps: number
  },
  termination_check: {
    detected: boolean,
    marker?: string
  },
  passed: boolean,
  violations: array,
  correction_applied: boolean,
  corrected_response: string|null
}
```

All changes follow the existing architectural patterns, maintain ES6 module syntax, preserve error handling patterns, and integrate seamlessly into the enforcement chain without disrupting existing phases.
