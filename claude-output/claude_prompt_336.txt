Issue #336: [claude-fix] Issue: cache_valid_until not being set for VOLATILE external lookups

Issue Description:
Context: Comprehensive test shows VOLATILE Bitcoin query returns:

external_lookup: true ✅
verified_at: "2026-01-03T03:06:29.018Z" ✅
cache_valid_until: null ❌

For VOLATILE queries, cache_valid_until should be set to verified_at + 5 minutes (the VOLATILE TTL).
Task: In /api/core/orchestrator.js, after performing external lookup for VOLATILE queries, calculate and set cache_valid_until:
javascriptif (truthTypeResult.type === 'VOLATILE') {
  const ttlMs = truthTypeResult.ttl_ms || 300000; // 5 minutes default
  phase4Metadata.cache_valid_until = new Date(Date.now() + ttlMs).toISOString();
}
Or pull it from the cache manager when storing the result.
Acceptance: Bitcoin query returns cache_valid_until with a timestamp ~5 minutes after verified_at.
