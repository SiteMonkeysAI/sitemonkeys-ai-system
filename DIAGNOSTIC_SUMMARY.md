## Key Findings

### Critical Bug Found: Vault Loading

**Issue:** HTTP method mismatch prevents vault from loading

**Root Cause:**
- Server registers: `app.post("/api/load-vault", ...)`
- Frontend calls: `method: "GET"`
- Express cannot match GET request to POST route
- Handler never executes, vault never loads

**Fix:** Change ONE WORD in server.js line 237
```javascript
// BEFORE:
app.post("/api/load-vault", loadVaultHandler);

// AFTER:
app.get("/api/load-vault", loadVaultHandler);
```

**Impact:** Blocks site_monkeys mode functionality entirely  
**Effort:** 1 minute to fix  
**Confidence:** 95% this resolves "No vault available" issue

### False Alarms Investigated

**Document Upload (NOT BROKEN):**
- Suspicion: Frontend array vs backend Map mismatch
- Reality: Intentionally different, both working correctly
- Frontend array: UI display only
- Backend Map: Actual storage for AI
- Orchestrator correctly retrieves from Map
- **Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING AS DESIGNED

**Token Tracking (NOT BROKEN):**
- Test suite confirms all tests passing
- Multiple personalities working
- Cost calculation accurate
- Error handling graceful
- **Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

### Verified Fixes

**Memory SQL Queries (ALREADY FIXED):**
- Old: `WHERE user_id = $1` (single user)
- New: `WHERE user_id IN ('user', 'anonymous')` (both users)
- Test suite confirms fix in place
- **Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED IN PREVIOUS PR

### Areas Needing Verification

**Memory Category Routing:**
- Code exists and looks correct
- Semantic analysis implemented
- Category scoring sophisticated
- **But:** Cannot verify accuracy without runtime testing
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING WITH REAL QUERIES

**Memory Similarity Scoring:**
- Algorithm implemented
- Content intelligence boosting in place
- Question filtering active
- **But:** Cannot verify effectiveness without real data
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING WITH REAL MEMORIES

## Test Results Summary

### Passing Tests (5/6)
1. ‚úÖ **test-startup.js** - System initialization working (1.5s startup)
2. ‚úÖ **test-memory-retrieval-fix.js** - SQL queries verified fixed

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Priority 1 - DO NOW)

**Fix Vault Loading**
- File: `server.js` line 237
- Change: `app.post` ‚Üí `app.get`
- Time: 1 minute
- Risk: Very low
- Impact: Unblocks site_monkeys mode

### Next Steps (Priority 2 - DO NEXT)

**Add Memory System Logging**
1. Log category routing decisions
2. Log similarity scores for all memories
3. Log which memories are selected vs. cut
- Time: 30 minutes
- Risk: None (just logging)
- Impact: Visibility into memory system

**Deploy and Test**
1. Deploy vault fix to Railway
2. Test vault loading end-to-end
3. Test memory retrieval with real queries
4. Monitor logs for routing and scoring
- Time: 2-3 hours
- Risk: Low (just testing)
- Impact: Verifies fixes work

### Future (Priority 3 - IF NEEDED)

**Tune Memory System**
- Adjust category keywords based on routing logs
- Adjust similarity weights based on scoring logs
- Increase token limits if memories are cut
- Time: 1-2 hours per adjustment
- Risk: Low (incremental tuning)
- Impact: Improves memory accuracy
