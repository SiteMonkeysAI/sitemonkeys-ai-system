# 🚀 QUICK START - Deployment Guide

## What Was Done
Comprehensive audit identified **critical routing mismatch** (100% failure rate).  
Implemented **3 surgical fixes**, all feature-flagged for safe deployment.

---

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1️⃣ Deploy Routing Fix (CRITICAL - Do This First!)

**In Railway Dashboard**:
1. Go to your app → Variables
2. Add: `ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_ROUTING` = `true`
3. Click "Redeploy"

**What This Fixes**:
- Solves "needle in haystack" (memories stored but never retrieved)
- Enables cross-category topic search
- Expected improvement: 0% → 80%+ routing success

**Monitor**:
```bash
# Check Railway logs for:
[INTELLIGENT-ROUTING] Low confidence, trying topic-based retrieval...
[INTELLIGENT-ROUTING] Found X additional memories via topic search
```

---

### 2️⃣ Enable Storage Compression (High Impact, Low Risk)

**In Railway Dashboard**:
1. Add: `ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_STORAGE` = `true`
2. Redeploy

**What This Does**:
- 10-20:1 compression (1000 token conversation → 50-100 tokens)
- De-duplicates similar memories (boosts existing vs creating duplicates)
- Massive database size reduction

**Monitor**:
```bash
# Check logs for:
[INTELLIGENT-STORAGE] 📊 Compression: 856 → 47 tokens (18.2:1)
[DEDUP] ♻️ Found similar memory, boosting instead of duplicating
```

---

### 3️⃣ Document Budget (OPTIONAL - Test First!)

**Only if you want to reduce from 10K to 1K tokens per document**:

1. Test with large documents first
2. If answers still accurate, add: `ENABLE_STRICT_DOC_BUDGET` = `true`
3. Redeploy

**Impact**: -9,000 tokens per document (42% total reduction)

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

**Instant rollback - no code changes required**:

In Railway Dashboard, set to `false` or remove:
- `ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_ROUTING`
- `ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_STORAGE`
- `ENABLE_STRICT_DOC_BUDGET`

System reverts to original behavior immediately.

---

## Test After Deployment

### Golden Test Cases
Try these to verify routing fix:

1. **Kids**: Say "My kids are Sarah and Jake" → Later ask "What are my kids' names?"
2. **Vehicles**: Say "I own a Honda Civic" → Later ask "What cars do I have?"
3. **Superhero**: Say "Favorite is Spider-Man" → Later ask "Who is my favorite hero?"

**Expected**: System should recall information (was 0% before fix)

---

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 After Deployment
- ✅ Routing match rate >80% (was 0%)
- ✅ Compression ratios 10-20:1
- ✅ De-duplication working (boost vs create)
- ✅ No increase in API costs

### Week 2+
- Monitor database size reduction
- Track user satisfaction with memory recall
- Verify answer accuracy maintained
