**SiteMonkeys\_AI\_UI\_EXECUTION\_STANDARD\_v1.0**

**Issued under: 00\_AI\_MANDATORY\_PROACTIVITY\_PROTOCOL**
**Purpose:** Define the minimum interface requirements for displaying, validating, and interacting with Zero-Failure protocol-enforced AI output across desktop and mobile platforms.

---

### **1. Dual-Panel Chat Interface**

* **Left Panel:** User messages (including AI prompts and override requests)
* **Right Panel:** AI responses (e.g., Eli or Roxy)
* Must support alternating response chains for rapid multi-turn auditability

---

### **2. Rocket Send Button**

* The message send button must display a large **rocket icon** similar in size and style to the reference image provided (`Rocket no smoke.png` or equivalent)
* Rocket must appear on mobile and desktop interfaces and may animate on message submission for visual confirmation

---

### **3. Vault Upload Confirmation Ribbon**

* Sidebar or status ribbon that shows:

  * ✅ Vault files successfully loaded
  * 🔄 Active protocol: 00\_AI\_MANDATORY\_PROACTIVITY\_PROTOCOL
  * 📂 Files referenced in current conversation
* Visual cue if vault data is incomplete, out of sync, or not cited in current message

---

### **4. Token + Cost Tracker**

* **Display token usage per message**
* Track cumulative token cost toward the \$3K monthly burn cap
* Display a visible warning if token usage or projected API billing exceeds 80% of monthly limit
* Optional: burn rate “fuel gauge” styled like a vertical or circular meter

---

### **5. Output Validation Checklist (Section 21)**

* A collapsible checklist or visual audit overlay should display:

  * ✅ Protocol header detected
  * ✅ Scenario summary present
  * ✅ Vault citations listed
  * ✅ At least 2–3 structured solutions
  * ✅ IP risk flagged (if applicable)
  * ✅ Preferred recommendation given
  * ✅ Validation loop included
* If any item is missing, system should show a flag (“⚠️ Incomplete Protocol Response”)

---

### **6. Response Bubble Behavior**

* Each AI message bubble should include:

  * 🔎 Hover/clickable view of Section 21 compliance markers
  * 📄 Button to download response + vault citation audit as PDF
  * 🔁 Regenerate option (with note: “Recheck for protocol compliance”)

---

### **7. Mobile Optimization Requirements**

* Chat column must collapse to single stacked mode on mobile
* Rocket button must remain fully visible and tappable
* Vault upload status should convert to a small badge or icon top-right
* Output checklist can be toggled from a floating menu or swipe panel

---

### **8. Styling Consistency**

* Branding must match SiteMonkeys style guide (colors, icons, fonts)
* Rocket icon and interface cues must reflect energy, precision, and authority
* Error messages, flex flags, and audit failures should use icon-enhanced alerts (🚨, ⚠️, 🔴)

---

### **Enforcement Layer Alignment**

This UI shell exists to surface, enforce, and visualize the behavioral logic defined in:

* **00\_AI\_MANDATORY\_PROACTIVITY\_PROTOCOL**
* **04\_QAProtocols.docx**
* **EnforcementShell\_Addendum.docx**

Any deviation from Section 21 formatting or failure to visualize constraint compliance constitutes a protocol breach and must be flagged in the UI.

**This standard is now in force across all SiteMonkeys interfaces.**
